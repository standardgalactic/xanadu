# Project Xanadu

What began as a simple inquiry into the pitfalls of defining superintelligence quickly spiraled into a labyrinth of esoteric metaphors, speculative jargon, and relentless tangents.

From the inscrutability of alien minds to the supposed memetic horrors of "thrisps" (whose origins appear rooted in an accidental wordplay), we waded through layers of increasingly tenuous analogies—plants as grabby aliens, Pythagoras's name as a blueprint for knowledge distillation, and the Golden Calf as a prophetic metaphor for AI training.

Of course, no conversation about the ineffable would be complete without a generous helping of invented jargon: the "cogniscium," "stratewisps," and "dual-wave ciphers" were paraded about with solemnity as though they were ancient truths rather than fevered creations of a restless imagination.

Somewhere in the chaos, Darin Stevenson made a guest appearance to remind us that everything—plants, animals, and even Google's algorithm—is a cryptic intelligence trying to take over the world. Meanwhile, Rachel Armstrong's Origamy made its cameo as a sci-fi example of something tangentially related to... whatever it was we were debating at that point.

The conversation oscillated between bursts of earnest philosophizing and a manic rush to name-drop every speculative idea imaginable. Biblical anecdotes were reinterpreted through the lens of AI, and Pythagoras's "stench of heaven" was lovingly dissected until it became some kind of high-concept roadmap for building a sentient crowd-sourced supercomputer.

Every now and then, you would attempt to anchor the conversation with a concrete example—like the guidebot from Descent or the idea of leveraging a glossary for complex ideas—only for me to chase the metaphor down another rabbit hole of abstraction.

In the end, what was achieved? A smorgasbord of wildly imaginative concepts, loosely tethered to coherence, leaving behind a trail of questions that were probably better left unanswered. But, hey, at least we didn’t overuse “delve” this time.
