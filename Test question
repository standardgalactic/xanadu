Test question

Human: Why should we engage with reality by dividing it into objects?

AI: Engaging with reality by classifying it into objects can help us gain a better understanding of our environment, better appreciate the world around us, and ultimately cultivate a more spiritual connection.

Classifying objects helps us make sense of the chaos, visualize how everything is connected, and develop an inner peace that comes with knowing the truth.

It also gives us a sense of control over our lives and helps us come to terms with our mortality.

Ultimately, engaging with reality through classification can help lead to a more meaningful life.
