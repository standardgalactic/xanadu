The article proposes a new method for reconstructing
high-resolution images from human brain activity obtained
through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
method is based on a latent diffusion model (LDM) called
Stable Diffusion, which reduces the computational cost of
diffusion models while preserving their high generative
performance. The article characterizes the inner
mechanisms of the LDM and shows that it can reconstruct
images with high fidelity without the need for additional
training or fine-tuning of deep-learning models. The
proposed method offers a promising approach for
understanding how the brain represents the world and for

preprint tion or imagery) from brain activity, and the
examinationof potential correspondences between the
computationalprocesses associated with biological and
artificial systems[2,  5, 7, 24,  25,  27,  36,
44–46].Reconstructing visual images from brain activity,
suchas that measured by functional Magnetic Resonance
Imag-ing (fMRI), is an intriguing but challenging problem,
be-cause the underlying representations in the brain are
largelyunknown, and the sample size typically associated
withbrain data is relatively small [17,26,   30,   32].
In recentyears, researchers have started addressing this
task usingdeep-learning models and algorithms, including
generativeadversarial networks (GANs) and self-supervised
learning[2,  5, 7, 24,  25,  27,  36,  44–46].
Additionally, more recentstudies have increased semantic
fidelity by explicitly usingthe semantic content of images
as auxiliary inputs for re-construction [5,25]. However,
these studies require train-ing new generative models with
fMRI data from scratch, orfine-tuning toward the specific
stimuli used in the fMRI ex-periment. These efforts have
shown impressive but limitedsuccess in pixel-wise and
semantic fidelity, partly becausethe number of samples in
neuroscience is small, and partlybecause learning complex
generative models poses numer-ous challenges.Diffusion
models (DMs) [11,47,  48,  53] are deep genera-tive models
that have been gaining attention in recent years.DMs have
achieved state-of-the-art performance in severaltasks
involving conditional image generation [4,39,  49], im-age
super resolution [40], image colorization [38], and
otherrelated tasks [6,16,  33,  41]. In addition, recently
proposedlatent diffusion models (LDMs) [37] have further
reducedcomputational costs by utilizing the latent space
generatedby their autoencoding component, enabling more
efficientcomputations in the training and inference
phases.  An-other advantage of LDMs is their ability to
generate high-resolution images with high semantic
fidelity. However, be-cause LDMs have been introduced only
recently, we stilllack a satisfactory understanding of
their internal mecha-nisms. Specifically, we still need to
discover how they rep-resent latent signals within each
layer of DMs, how the la-tent representation changes
throughout the denoising pro-cess, and how adding noise
affects conditional image gen-eration.Here, we attempt to
tackle the above challenges by re-constructing visual
images from fMRI signals using anLDM named Stable
Diffusion. This architecture is trainedon a large dataset
and carries high text-to-image genera-tive performance. We
show that our simple framework canreconstruct
high-resolution images with high semantic fi-delity
without any training or fine-tuning of complex
deep-learning models. We also provide biological
interpretationsof each component of the LDM, including
forward/reversediffusion processes, U-Net, and latent
representations withdifferent noise levels.Our
contributions are as follows: (i) We demonstratethat our
simple framework can reconstruct high-resolution(512⇥512)
images from brain activity with high seman-tic fidelity,
without the need for training or fine-tuning ofcomplex
deep generative models (Figure1); (ii) We quan-titatively
interpret each component of an LDM from a neu-roscience
perspective, by mapping specific components todistinct
brain regions; (iii) We present an objective
interpre-tation of how the text-to-image conversion
process imple-mented by an LDM incorporates the semantic
informationexpressed by the conditional text, while at the
same timemaintaining the appearance of the original
image.2. Related Work2.1. Reconstructing visual image from
fMRIDecoding visual experiences from fMRI activity hasbeen
studied in various modalities. Examples include
ex-plicitly presented visual stimuli [17,26,  30,  32],
semanticcontent of the presented stimuli [15,31,  52],
imagined con-tent [13,29], perceived emotions [12,20,
51], and manyother related applications [14,28]. In
general, these decod-ing tasks are made difficult by the
low signal-to-noise ratioand the relatively small sample
size associated with fMRIdata.While early attempts have
used handcrafted features toreconstruct visual images from
fMRI [17,26,  30,  32], recentstudies have begun to use
deep generative models trained ona large number of
naturalistic images [2,5, 7, 24,  25,  27,  36,44–46].
Additionally, a few studies have used semantic
in-formation associated with the images, including
categoricalor text information, to increase the semantic
fidelity of thereconstructed images [5,25]. To produce
high-resolutionreconstructions, these studies require
training and possiblyfine-tuning of generative models,
such as GANs, with thesame dataset used in the fMRI
experiments. These require-ments impose serious
limitations, because training complexgenerative models is
in general challenging, and the num-ber of samples in
neuroscience is relatively small. Thus,even modern
implementations struggle to produce images,at
most256⇥256resolution, with high semantic fidelityunless
they are augmented with numerous tools and tech-niques.
DMs and LDMs are recent algorithms for imagegeneration
that could potentially address these limitations,thanks to
their ability to generate diverse high-resolutionimages
with high semantic fidelity of text-conditioning, andhigh
computational efficiency. However, to the best of
ourknowledge

via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a
latent diffusion model (LDM) called Stable Diffusion. The
LDM reduces the computational cost of diffusion models
while preserving their high generative performance. The
paper also characterizes the inner mechanisms of the LDM
by studying how its different components relate to
distinct brain functions. The proposed method can
reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity
without the need for additional training and fine-tuning
of complex deep-learning models. The paper provides a
promising method for reconstructing images from human
brain activity and provides a new framework for
understanding diffusion models.

2.2. Encoding ModelsTo understand deep-learning models
from a biologicalperspective, neuroscientists have
employed encoding mod-els: a predictive model of brain
activity is built out offeatures extracted from different
components of the deep-learning models, followed by
examination of the poten-tial link between model
representations and correspondingbrain processes
[3,8–10,13,  18,  19,  21,  42,  43,  54,  55]. Be-cause
brains and deep-learning models share similar goals(e.g.,
recognition of the world) and thus could implementsimilar
functions, the ability to establish connections be-tween
these two structures provides us with biological
in-terpretations of the architecture underlying
deep-learningmodels, otherwise viewed as black boxes.  For
example,the activation patterns observed within early and
late layersof a CNN correspond to the neural activity
patterns mea-sured from early and late layers of visual
cortex, suggest-ing the existence of a hierarchical
correspondence betweenlatent representations of a CNN and
those present in thebrain [9,10,  13,  19,  54,  55].
This approach has been ap-plied primarily to vision
science, but it has recently beenextended to other sensory
modalities and higher functions[3,  8, 18,  21,  42,
43].Compared with biologically inspired architectures
suchas CNNs, the correspondence between DMs and the
brainis less obvious. By examining the relationship
between eachcomponent and process of DMs and corresponding
brain ac-tivities, we were able to obtain biological
interpretations ofDMs, for example in terms of how latent
vectors, denois-ing processes, conditioning operations,
and U-net compo-nents may correspond to our visual
streams. To our knowl-edge, no prior study has
investigated the relationship be-tween DMs and the
brain.Together, our overarching goal is to use DMs for
highresolution visual reconstruction and to use brain
encodingframework to better understand the underlying
mechanismsof DMs and its correspondence to the brain.3.

The article describes a study in which the authors used
deep learning models (DMs) to reconstruct high-resolution
images from fMRI signals recorded while subjects viewed
natural scenes. They also used encoding models to examine
the relationship between the components of the DMs and
corresponding brain activity patterns. The Natural Scenes
Dataset (NSD) was used for the study, which includes fMRI
data from four subjects who viewed 10,000 images during
30-40 imaging sessions. The images used in the NSD
experiments were retrieved from MS COCO and cropped to 425
x 425 pixels. The authors used 27,750 trials from NSD for
each subject, with a subset of 2,770 trials used as the
test dataset and the remaining trials used as the training
dataset. The authors also provide details of the
preprocessing protocol used for the functional data, which
involved several steps including motion correction,
distortion correction, and normalization.

Diffusion ModelsDMs are probabilistic generative models
that restore asampled variable from Gaussian noise to a
sample of thelearned data distribution via iterative
denoising.  Giventraining data, the diffusion process
destroys the structure ofthe data by gradually adding
Gaussian noise. The sampleat each time point is defined
asxt=p↵tx0+p1↵t✏twherextis a noisy version of
inputx0,t2{1,...,T},↵is a hyperparameter, and✏is the
Gaussian. The inversediffusion process is modeled by
applying a neural networkf✓(xt,t)to the samples at each
step to recover the origi-nal input. The learning
objective isf✓(x,t)t✏t[11,   47].U-Net is commonly used
for neural networksf✓.This method can be generalized to
learning conditionaldistributions by inserting auxiliary
inputcinto the neuralnetwork. If we set the latent
representation of the text se-quence toc, it can implement
text-to-image models. Recentstudies have shown that, by
using large language and imagemodels, DMs can create
realistic, high-resolution imagesfrom text inputs.
Furthermore, when we start from sourceimage with input
texts, we can generate new text conditionalimages by
editing the image. In this image-to-image trans-lation,
the degree of degradation from the original image
iscontrolled by a parameter that can be adjusted to
preserveeither the semantic content or the appearance of
the originalimage.DMs that operate in pixel space are
computationally ex-pensive. LDMs overcome this limitation
by compressingthe input using an autoencoder (Figure2,
top).  Specifi-cally, the autoencoder is first trained
with image data, andthe diffusion model is trained to
generate its latent repre-sentationzusing a U-Net
architecture. In doing so, it refersto conditional inputs
via cross-attention. This allows forlightweight inference
compared with pixel-based DMs, andfor very high-quality
text-to-image and image-to-image im-plementations.In this
study, we used an LDM called Stable Diffu-sion, which was
built on LDMs and trained on a very largedataset. The
model can generate and modify images basedon text input.
Text input is projected to a fixed latent repre-sentation
by a pretrained text encoder (CLIP) [34]. We usedversion
1.4 of the model. See AppendixA for details on thetraining
protocol.We definezas the latent representation of the
originalimage compressed by the autoencoder,cas the latent
rep-resentation of texts (average of five text annotations
asso-ciated to each MS COCO image), andzcas the
generatedlatent representation ofzmodified by the model
withc.Weused these representations in the
decoding/encoding modelsdescribed below.3.3. Decoding:
reconstructing images from fMRIWe performed visual
reconstruction from fMRI signalsusing LDM in three simple
steps as follows (Figure2, mid-dle). The only training
required in our method is to con-struct linear models that
map fMRI signals to each LDMcomponent, and no training or
fine-tuning of deep-learningmodels is needed. We used the
default parameters of image-to-image and text-to-image
codes provided by the authors ofLDM2, including the
parameters used for the DDIM sam-pler. See AppendixA for
details.(i) First, we predicted a latent representationzof
thepresented imageXfrom fMRI signals within early
visualcortex.zwas then processed by an decoder of
autoen-coder to produce a coarse decoded imageXzwith a
sizeof320⇥320, and then resized it to512⇥512.(ii)Xzwas
then processed by encoder of autoencoder,then added noise
through the diffusion process.(iii) We decoded latent text
representationscfrom fMRIsignals within higher (ventral)
visual cortex. Noise-addedlatent representationszTof the
coarse image and decodedcwere used as input to the
denoising U-Net to producezc.Finally,zcwas used as input
to the decoding module ofthe autoencoder to produce a
final reconstructed imageXzcwith a size of512⇥512.To
construct models from fMRI to the components ofLDM, we
used L2-regularized linear regression, and allmodels were
built on a per subject basis.  Weights wereestimated from
training data, and regularization parame-ters were
explored during the training using 5-fold
cross-validation. We resized original images
from425⇥425to320⇥320but confirmed that resizing them to a
larger size(448⇥448) does not affect the quality of
reconstruction.As control analyses, we also generated
images usingonlyzorc. To generate these control images, we
simplyomittedcorzfrom step (iii) above, respectively.The
accuracy of image reconstruction was evaluated
ob-jectively (perceptual similarity metrics, PSMs) and
subjec-tively (human raters, N=6) by assessing whether the
origi-nal test images (N=982 images) could be identified
from thegenerated images. As a similarity metrics of PSMs,
we usedearly/middle/late layers of CLIP and CNN (AlexNet)
[22].Briefly, we conducted two-way identification
experiments:examined whether the image reconstructed from
fMRI wasmore similar to the corresponding original image
than ran-domly picked reconstructed image. See AppendixB

Assistant:

What are Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and how are they
used in visual reconstruction from fMRI signals?

User:

They are models for constructing from noise and
deconstructing images while adding noise. I assume they
calibrate the image being seen with the fmri information.

Assistant:

It is possible that the models you are referring to are
generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which can
generate images from random noise and also learn to
reconstruct images with added noise. These models have
been used in conjunction with fMRI data to explore the
relationship between brain activity and visual perception.

In these studies, the generative models can be trained to
generate images that are similar to the ones that a
subject might see during a fMRI experiment. The models can
then be used to explore how the brain represents and
processes visual information by comparing the fMRI
activity patterns observed while viewing natural images to
the activity patterns predicted by the generative models.

Similarly, the models can also be used to reconstruct
degraded images by adding noise and using the learned
relationships between the noise and the underlying image
to estimate the original image. This can be useful in
situations where the original image is not available or
has been degraded by factors such as noise or blur.

Overall, the combination of generative models and fMRI
data has the potential to provide insights into how the
brain processes and represents visual information, and to
develop new tools for analyzing and interpreting brain
activity patterns.

3.4. Encoding: Whole-brain Voxel-wise ModelingNext, we
tried to interpret the internal operations ofLDMs by
mapping them to brain activity. For this purpose,we
constructed whole-brain voxel-wise encoding modelsfor the
following four settings (see Figure2 bottom and Ap-pendixA
for implementation details):(i) We first built linear
models to predict voxel activityfrom the following three
latent representations of the LDMindependently:z,c,
andzc.(ii) Althoughzcandzproduce different images,
theyresult in similar prediction maps on the cortex
(see4.2.1).Therefore, we incorporated them into a single
model, andfurther examined how they differ by mapping the
uniquevariance explained by each feature onto cortex [23].
Tocontrol the balance between the appearance of the
originalimage and the semantic fidelity of the conditional
text, wevaried the level of noise added toz. This analysis
enabledquantitative interpretation of the image-to-image
process.(iii) While LDMs are characterized as an iterative
de-noising process, the internal dynamics of the denoising
pro-cess are poorly understood. To gain some insight into
thisprocess, we examined howzcchanges through the
denois-ing process. To do so, we extractedzcfrom the
early, mid-dle, and late steps of the denoising. We then
constructedcombined models withzas in the above analysis
(ii), andmapped their unique variance onto cortex.(iv)
Finally, to inspect the last black box associated
withLDMs, we extracted features from different layers of
U-Net.For different steps of the denoising, encoding
models wereconstructed independently with different U-Net
layers: twofrom the first stage, one from the bottleneck
stage, and twofrom the second stage. We then identified
the layer withhighest accuracy for each voxel and for each
step.Model weights were estimated from training data
usingL2-regularized linear regression, and subsequently
appliedto test data (see AppendixA for details). For
evaluation, weused Pearson’s correlation coefficients
between predictedand measured fMRI signals. We computed
statistical sig-nificance (one-sided) by comparing the
estimated correla-tions to the null distribution of
correlations between twoindependent Gaussian random
vectors of the same length(N=982). The statistical
threshold was set atP<0.05andcorrected for multiple
comparisons using the FDR proce-dure. We show results from
a single random seed, but weverified that different random
seed produced nearly identi-cal results (see AppendixC).
We reduced all feature dimen-sions to 6,400 by applying
principal component analysis, byestimating components
within training data.Figure 3. Presented (red box) and
reconstructed images for a sin-gle subject (subj01)
usingz,c, andzc.4. Results4.1. DecodingFigure3 shows the
results of visual reconstruction forone subject (subj01).
We generated five images for eachtest image and selected
the generated images with high-est PSMs. On the one hand,
images reconstructed usingonlyzwere visually consistent
with the original images,but failed to capture their
semantic content. On the otherhand, images reconstructed
using onlycgenerated imageswith high semantic fidelity but
were visually inconsistent.Finally, images reconstructed
usingzccould generate high-resolution images with high
semantic fidelity (see AppendixB for more
examples).Figure4 shows reconstructed images from all
subjectsfor the same image (all images were generated
usingzc.Other examples are available in the AppendixB).
Overall,reconstruction quality was stable and accurate
across sub-jects.We note that, the lack of agreement
regarding specificdetails of the reconstructed images may
differences in per-ceived experience across subjects,
rather than failures of re-construction. Alternatively it
may simply reflect differencesin data quality among
subjects. Indeed, subjects with high(subj01) and low
(subj07) decoding accuracy from fMRIwere subjects with
high and low data quality metrics, re-spectively (see
AppendixB).Figure5 plots results for the quantitative

The authors constructed whole-brain voxel-wise encoding
models to interpret the internal operations of the LDMs by
mapping them to brain activity. They built linear models
to predict voxel activity from the three latent
representations of the LDM independently (z, c, and zc),
and then incorporated zc into a single model to examine
how they differ by mapping the unique variance explained
by each feature onto the cortex. They also examined how zc
changes through the denoising process and extracted
features from different layers of U-Net to inspect the
last black box associated with LDMs.

The model weights were estimated from training data using
L2-regularized linear regression and subsequently applied
to test data. The authors used Pearson’s correlation
coefficients between predicted and measured fMRI signals
for evaluation, and computed statistical significance
(one-sided) by comparing the estimated correlations to the
null distribution of correlations between two independent
Gaussian random vectors of the same length. The
statistical threshold was set at P < 0.05 and corrected
for multiple comparisons using the FDR procedure.

The results showed that images reconstructed using only z
were visually consistent with the original images but
failed to capture their semantic content. Images
reconstructed using only c generated images with high
semantic fidelity but were visually inconsistent. Finally,
images reconstructed using zc could generate
high-resolution images with high semantic fidelity. The
lack of agreement regarding specific details of the
reconstructed images may reflect differences in perceived
experience across subjects or differences in data quality
among subjects.

Where they trying to predict which image they were looking

Assistant:

Yes, that is correct. The researchers were trying to
decode the visual information represented in fMRI data
collected from participants as they viewed natural images.
They used a deep learning model called a latent
deconvolutional model (LDM) to reconstruct the images
participants were viewing from the fMRI data. They then
evaluated the accuracy of their reconstructed images by
comparing them to the actual images viewed by
participants.

LayersFinally, we asked what information is being

the bottleneck layer of U-Net (col-ored orange) produces
the highest prediction performanceacross cortex. However,
as denoising progresses, the earlylayer of U-Net (colored
blue) predicts activity within earlyvisual cortex, and the
bottleneck layer shifts toward superiorpredictive power
for higher visual cortex.These results suggest that, at
the beginning of the reversediffusion process, image
information is compressed withinthe bottleneck layer. As
denoising progresses, a functionaldissociation among U-Net
layers emerges within visual cor-tex: i.e., the first
layer tends to represent fine-scale detailsin early visual
areas, while the bottleneck layer correspondsto
higher-order information in more ventral, semantic
areas.Progress=20%Progress=66%Progress=100%Figure 9.

reconstruction method usingLDMs.  We show that our method
can reconstruct high-resolution images with high semantic
fidelity from humanbrain activity. Unlike previous studies
of image reconstruc-tion, our method does not require
training or fine-tuningof complex deep-learning models: it
only requires simplelinear mappings from fMRI to latent
representations withinLDMs.We also provide a quantitative
interpretation for the in-ternal components of the LDM by
building encoding mod-els. For example, we demonstrate the
emergence of seman-tic content throughout the inverse
diffusion process, we per-form layer-wise characterization
of U-Net, and we providea quantitative interpretation of
image-to-image transforma-tions with different noise
levels. Although DMs are devel-oping rapidly, their
internal processes remain poorly under-stood. This study

Overall, the study suggests that LDMs could be a useful
tool for investigating the neural representations of
visual information in the brain. The ability to
reconstruct images from brain activity could have
important applications in fields such as neuroimaging and
brain-computer interfaces. Additionally, the quantitative
interpretation of the internal processes of LDMs could
help us better understand how the brain processes visual
information, and potentially lead to new insights into the

What is the purpose of the paper "Self-supervised natural
image reconstruction and large-scale semantic
classification from brain activity"?

User:

Abstract Reconstructing natural images and decoding their
semantic category from fMRI brain recordings is
challenging. Acquiring sufficient pairs of images and
their corresponding fMRI responses, which span the huge
space of natural images, is prohibitive. We present a
novel self-supervised approach that goes well beyond the
scarce paired data, for achieving both: (i) state-of-the
art fMRI-to-image reconstruction, and (ii) first-ever
large-scale semantic classification from fMRI responses.
By imposing cycle consistency between a pair of deep
neural networks (from image-to-fMRI & from fMRI-to-image),
we train our image reconstruction network on a large
number of “unpaired” natural images (images without fMRI
recordings) from many novel semantic categories. This
enables to adapt our reconstruction network to a very rich
semantic coverage without requiring any explicit semantic
supervision. Specifically, we find that combining our
self-supervised training with high-level perceptual
losses, gives rise to new reconstruction & classification
capabilities. In particular, this perceptual training
enables to classify well fMRIs of never-before-seen
semantic classes, without requiring any class labels
during training. This gives rise to: (i) Unprecedented
image-reconstruction from fMRI of never-before-seen images
(evaluated by image metrics and human testing), and (ii)
Large-scale semantic classification of categories that
were never-before-seen during network training. Such
large-scale (1000-way) semantic classification from fMRI
recordings has never been demonstrated before. Finally, we
provide evidence for the biological consistency of our
learned model.

Assistant:

In this paper, the authors present a self-supervised
approach for reconstructing natural images and decoding
their semantic category from fMRI brain recordings. The
challenge of acquiring sufficient pairs of images and
their corresponding fMRI responses, which span the huge
space of natural images, is addressed by training a pair
of deep neural networks (from image-to-fMRI and from
fMRI-to-image) on a large number of "unpaired" natural
images (images without fMRI recordings) from many novel
semantic categories. The networks are trained to be cycle
consistent, which enables the reconstruction network to
adapt to a very rich semantic coverage without requiring
any explicit semantic supervision. By combining this
self-supervised training with high-level perceptual
losses, the authors demonstrate new reconstruction and
classification capabilities. Specifically, the perceptual
training enables the network to classify fMRIs of
never-before-seen semantic classes, without requiring any
class labels during training. This gives rise to
unprecedented image-reconstruction from fMRI of
never-before-seen images and large-scale semantic
classification of categories that were never-before-seen
during network training. The authors also provide evidence
for the biological consistency of their learned model.

Probabilistic Diffusion in Random Network Graphs Dr.
Natarajan Meghanathan Professor of Computer Science
Jackson State University, MS, USA E-mail:
natarajan.meghanathan@jsums.edu Abstract In this paper, we
consider a random network such that there could be a link
between any two nodes in the network with a certain
probability (plink). Diffusion is the phenomenon of
spreading information throughout the network, starting
from one or more initial set of nodes (called the early
adopters). Information spreads along the links with a
certain probability (pdiff). Diffusion happens in rounds
with the first round involving the early adopters. The
nodes that receive the information for the first time are
said to be covered and become candidates for diffusion in
the subsequent round. Diffusion continues until all the
nodes in the network have received the information
(successful diffusion) or there are no more candidate
nodes to spread the information but one or more nodes are
yet to receive the information (diffusion failure). On the
basis of exhaustive simulations conducted in this paper,
we observe that for a given plink and pdiff values, the
fraction of successful diffusion attempts does not
appreciably change with increase in the number of early
adopters; whereas, the average number of rounds per
successful diffusion attempt decreases with increase in
the number of early adopters. The invariant nature of the
fraction of successful diffusion attempts with increase in
the number of early adopters for a random network (for
fixed plink and pdiff values) is an interesting and
noteworthy observation (for further research) and it has
not been hitherto reported in the literature. Keywords:
Probabilistic Diffusion, Random Network Graphs, Early
Adopters, Simulations 1 Introduction We envision a random
network of nodes such that information could propagate
along any link with a certain probability. We are
interested in the problem of analyzing how fast
information (for example, the availability of funds, need
for help, etc) originating from one or more nodes
(referred to as the early adopters) in the network can
diffuse (spread) to the other nodes of the network. Note
that diffusion may not happen across all the links because
there is only a certain chance with which a node may share
the information to its neighbor node. Though probabilistic
diffusion has been widely studied in the area of complex
network analysis, most of the studies (e.g., [3, 6, 8])
are restricted to real-world network models and not
conducted on theoretical models such as those that
correspond to the random networks. Our conjecture is that
phenomenon observed in random network models could be
construed as those that simply happen by chance (due to
the degree distribution of the vertices and not due to the
nodes involved). If a similar phenomenon is observed in a
real-world network whose degree distribution is similar to
that of a random network, then we could conclude that the
phenomenon observed in the real- world network also simply
happens due to the distribution of the vertices and not
due to the specific nature of the nodes involved. The
above characteristic of random networks forms the
motivation for our research in this paper. We are
interested in analyzing the impact of increase in the
number of early adopters on the success of diffusion in a
random network (i.e., whether all the nodes in the network
receive the information) and the delay associated with a
successful diffusion attempt. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows: Section 2 presents the system model
and explains the diffusion phenomenon in random network
graphs with an example. Section 3 presents the algorithm
to construct random networks and presents the results of
the simulation analyzing the impact of the number of early
adopters on diffusion in a random network. Section 4
discusses related work. Section 5 draws

some conclusions and suggests future directions for
research.

2 System Model We consider a random network of n nodes
such that any two nodes could be connected with a certain
probability plink. The links in the network are
bidirectional. We use an adjacency matrix A of size n × n
to represent the network where A[i, j] = 1 if there exists
a link from node i to node j and 0 otherwise.

Diffusion is the process of spreading information
throughout the network, starting from one or more initial
set of nodes (called the early adopters). Information
spreads along the links with a certain probability pdiff.
We assume that in each round of diffusion, the early
adopters transmit the information to their neighbor nodes
with probability pdiff. The nodes that receive the
information for the first time are said to be covered and
become candidates for diffusion in the subsequent round.
The diffusion process continues until all the nodes in the
network have received the information (successful
diffusion) or there are no more candidate nodes to spread
the information but one or more nodes are yet to receive
the information (diffusion failure).

To illustrate the diffusion process, consider a network of
6 nodes as shown in Fig. 1. The adjacency matrix A for
this network is as follows:

1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 0 1

Suppose nodes 1 and 2 are the early adopters and the
probability of diffusion (pdiff) is 0.5. In the first
round, nodes 1 and 2 transmit the information to their
neighbors (nodes 3 and 4). The nodes 3 and 4 are said to
be covered in this round. In the second round, nodes 3 and
4 transmit the information to their neighbors (nodes 1, 2,
4, and 5). The nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 are said to be covered
in this round. In the third round, nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5
transmit the information to their neighbors (nodes 3 and
6). The nodes 3 and 6 are said to be covered in this
round. The information has now been transmitted to all
nodes in the network and the diffusion is successful.

3 Simulation Results We conducted exhaustive simulations
to analyze the impact of the number of early adopters on
the success of diffusion in a random network. We fixed the
probability of link formation (plink) and the probability
of diffusion (pdiff) and varied the number of early
adopters. For each combination of plink, pdiff, and the
number of early adopters, we conducted 1000 simulations
and recorded the number of rounds taken for successful
diffusion and whether the diffusion was successful or not.

Our simulation results indicate that for a given plink and
pdiff, the fraction of successful diffusion attempts does
not appreciably change with an increase in the number of
early adopters. However, the average number of rounds per
successful diffusion attempt decreases with an increase in
the number of early adopters. This is an interesting
observation as it implies that the number of early
adopters required for successful diffusion can be reduced
by increasing the probability of link formation and/or
diffusion probability.

studies in this area have focused on real-world network
models and not theoretical models such as random networks.
For example, the work by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos [1]
studied the problem of selecting a small set of initial
seed nodes in a network to maximize the spread of
influence. This work was later extended to the case of
multiple cascades by Gomez-Rodriguez et al. [2]. Other
works have focused on studying the impact of network
topology and the distribution of node degrees on the
spread of influence [3, 4, 5].

In terms of analyzing diffusion in random networks, there
has been some previous work in this area. For example, the
work by Karrer and Newman [6] studied the problem of
percolation in random networks, where nodes are considered
active if they are connected to a certain number of other
active nodes. The work by Chakrabarti et al. [7] studied
the impact of network topology on the spread of a virus in
a random network. However, to the best of our knowledge,
no previous work has studied the impact of the number of
early adopters on diffusion in random networks.

User:

Explain plink and pdiff, again

Assistant:

Sure, in the context of the paper, "plink" refers to the
probability of a link between any two nodes in the
network, and "pdiff" refers to the probability of
information spreading along the links.

So, in other words, plink determines the likelihood of a
connection between two nodes in the network, while pdiff
determines the likelihood of information being transmitted
through that connection between the two nodes.

User:

probability of link formation (plink) and the probability
of diffusion (pdiff)

Assistant:

The probability of link formation (plink) refers to the
likelihood that there is a connection between any two
nodes in a given network. In other words, it is the
probability that a link exists between any pair of nodes
in the network.

The probability of diffusion (pdiff) refers to the
likelihood that information will be spread along a link
between two nodes in the network. In other words, it is
the probability that a node will pass the information it
receives on to its neighbors, and that those neighbors
will in turn pass it on to their neighbors, and so on,
until the information has reached all the nodes in the
network that can receive it.

User:

And what is a "early adopter"?

Assistant:

An early adopter is a node in the network that initially
receives and starts to spread the information or influence
in the network. In the context of the paper, the early
adopters are the starting point for the diffusion process
in the network.

User:

Explain again what is a diffusion network.

Assistant:

A diffusion network is a type of network where the goal is
to understand how information or influence can spread
across the nodes of the network. In a diffusion network,
nodes can be individuals, organizations, or any other type
of entity, and the links between them represent the
potential for information or influence to flow from one
node to another. The process of information or influence
spreading through the network is known as diffusion, and
it can be modeled using various mathematical and
computational methods. Understanding how diffusion works
in a network can have important applications in fields
such as marketing, public health, and social network
analysis.

Assistant:

Latent diffusion and stable diffusion are two different
approaches to generative modeling.

Latent diffusion models are a type of generative model
that learns to map the latent space of an image generator
network to the space of text descriptions. These models
can generate highly realistic images from textual
descriptions.

On the other hand, stable diffusion is a technique that
speeds up the image generation process by running the
diffusion process on a compressed version of the image
rather than on the pixel image itself. This technique is
used in the stable diffusion algorithm to generate
high-quality images efficiently.

In summary, latent diffusion models focus on generating
high-quality images from text descriptions, while stable
diffusion focuses on speeding up the image generation
process through the use of compressed data.

What is latent diffusion for Stable Diffusion? Stable
Diffusion uses a kind of diffusion model (DM), called a
latent diffusion model (LDM). Introduced in 2015,
diffusion models are trained with the objective of
removing successive applications of Gaussian noise on

Assistant:

In Stable Diffusion, a latent diffusion model (LDM) is
used. A latent diffusion model is a type of diffusion
model (DM) that involves mapping a set of latent variables
to the observed data. The model is trained by applying a
sequence of Gaussian noise to the training images, which
can be thought of as a sequence of denoising autoencoders.
The LDM maps a set of latent variables to the space of the
observed data, allowing it to generate images that are
representative of the data. The diffusion process is run
on a compressed version of the image, which speeds up the
image generation process.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org › wiki Latent space - Wikipedia

Assistant:

In deep learning, the term "latent" usually refers to
hidden or unobservable variables or representations.
Latent variables are not directly observed but inferred
from other observable variables. In the context of neural
networks, latent variables can be learned from input data
and can represent underlying patterns or features that are
not explicitly represented in the input. The latent space
refers to the space where these latent variables exist. It
is an abstract space where different representations of
the input data are organized in such a way that similar
items are closer to each other. The concept of the latent
space is crucial in deep learning because it allows for
the automatic discovery of meaningful patterns and
features in data.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based image
prediction is a research field that involves using fMRI
data to predict the content of visual images that
participants are viewing or imagining. This typically
involves training a machine learning algorithm on fMRI
data collected while participants view or imagine various
images, and then using that trained algorithm to predict
the image content from new fMRI data. The goal is to
better understand how the brain processes visual
information and to develop more accurate methods for
reconstructing mental imagery from brain activity.

Latent space.

Assistant:

In machine learning, the term "latent space" refers to a
conceptual space where the input data is transformed into
a more compact and meaningful representation. Latent space
is a lower-dimensional space that captures the essential
characteristics or features of the original
high-dimensional input data.

For example, in an image recognition problem, the latent
space might represent various features of the image, such
as the edges, shapes, textures, or colors. The goal of the
learning process is to map the input data into the latent
space, where the data can be manipulated, transformed, or
generated.

Latent space is used in many machine learning models, such
as autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative
adversarial networks (GANs), and deep belief networks. By
leveraging the latent space representation, these models
can learn to generate new data, manipulate existing data,
or perform other complex tasks with improved efficiency
and effectiveness.

User:

A latent space, also known as a latent feature space or
embedding space, is an embedding of a set of items within
a manifold in which items resembling each other are
positioned closer to one another in the latent space.
Position within the latent space can be viewed as being
defined by a set of latent variables that emerge from the
resemblances from the objects.

In most cases, the dimensionality of the latent space is
chosen to be lower than the dimensionality of the feature
space from which the data points are drawn, making the
construction of a latent space an example of
dimensionality reduction, which can also be viewed as a
form of data compression.[1] Latent spaces are usually fit
via machine learning, and they can then be used as feature
spaces in machine learning models, including classifiers
and other supervised predictors.

Assistant:

In addition to dimensionality reduction and data
compression, latent spaces also have other applications in
machine learning. One important application is generative
modeling, where the latent space is used to generate new
data points that are similar to those in the original
dataset. Latent spaces are also used in unsupervised
learning, where the goal is to identify patterns in data
without explicit labels or targets. In this context,
latent spaces can help identify groups or clusters of data
points that share common features or characteristics.

Latent spaces have been used in a variety of fields,
including computer vision, natural language processing,
and music analysis. One example of the use of latent
spaces is in image generation, where a generative model is
trained on a dataset of images and learns to map points in
the latent space to corresponding images. This allows the
model to generate new images that are similar to those in
the original dataset but are not identical to any specific
image.

Overall, latent spaces are a powerful tool in machine
learning that allow for dimensionality reduction, data
compression, generative modeling, and unsupervised
learning.

User:

Give some everyday example analogies.

Assistant:

Sure, here are a few everyday analogies that might help
illustrate the concept of a latent space:

1 Imagine you are trying to organize your bookshelf. You
have a lot of books that cover a wide variety of
topics, but you want to group them together in a way
that makes sense. One approach might be to create a
latent space based on the topics covered in each book.
For example, books about history could be placed close
together in the latent space, while books about cooking
could be grouped together in another area. By doing
this, you are essentially creating a simplified
representation of your book collection that allows you
to quickly find the books you want based on their
topic.
2 Suppose you are trying to categorize different types of
music. Again, there are many different genres and
sub-genres to consider, but you want to group them
together in a way that makes sense. One approach might
be to create a latent space based on the features of
each song, such as tempo, rhythm, and melody. By doing
this, you could group songs that sound similar together
in the latent space, even if they come from different
genres.
3 Imagine you are trying to describe the flavor of
different types of coffee. There are many different
ways to describe coffee, such as bitter, acidic, or
nutty. However, these descriptions can be subjective
and difficult to compare directly. One approach might
be to create a latent space based on the chemical
compounds present in each type of coffee. By doing
this, you could group coffees that have similar
chemical profiles together in the latent space, which
might provide a more objective way to compare and
contrast different types of coffee.

User:

Ok I have my books organized by height and color, it seems
to accidentally sort into topics as well, in a kind of
weird way.

Assistant:

Interesting! It's not uncommon for people to organize
their books based on aesthetics like color, height, or
even texture. It's great that it also accidentally sorted
into topics, even if it wasn't your intention. It could be
a fun experiment to try intentionally organizing your
books by topic to see if it changes your reading habits or
helps you discover new connections between different
books.

User:

Explain this using the latent space analogy.

Assistant:

In the context of organizing books, the latent space
analogy suggests that the organization of books by height
and color may have created an unintended but useful
"latent space" for grouping books by topic. The latent
variables that define the position of each book within the
latent space may be related to its topic or subject
matter, despite the fact that height and color were not
chosen for this purpose.

By arranging the books in this way, the latent variables
that define the position of each book within the latent
space may have become aligned with the latent variables
that define the topic or subject matter of the books. This
alignment may have occurred because books on similar
topics tend to have similar colors or similar heights,
which resulted in them being grouped together in the
organization scheme.

Thus, even though the organization scheme was not designed
with the intention of grouping books by topic, the latent
space that emerged as a result of the organization may
have inadvertently captured information about the
relationships between books and their topics. This is a
good example of how latent spaces can be used to reveal
hidden relationships between data points, even when those
relationships are not explicitly defined or designed for.

User:

Like it seems like there are some unwritten rules among
publishers about the meanings of certain colors . My
largest books tend to be textbooks. Orange seems to be
mathematics, dictionaries, Latin textbooks, the ingenuity

as my psychology textbook, biology is grey; cattus

the only books on this shelf in green. On another shelf,
science & music by James Jeans; Hegel, Heidegger and the
ground of history, and the Hebrew alphabet coloring book
are the only books in green on another shelf.

Assistant:

Using the latent space analogy, we can think of the books
as data points in a high-dimensional feature space, where
each dimension corresponds to a particular feature of the
book (e.g., author, subject matter, cover color, etc.).
When you organize your books by height and color, you are
effectively projecting these high-dimensional data points
onto a lower-dimensional space, which can be thought of as
a latent space. The specific organization scheme you use
(height and color) can be seen as a way of defining the
axes of this latent space.

In this latent space, books that are similar to each other
(i.e., have similar features) will be positioned closer
together, while books that are dissimilar will be farther
apart. It seems that some publishers may have adopted
certain color schemes for book covers that are associated
with specific subject areas (e.g., orange for
mathematics). By organizing your books according to color,
you are inadvertently clustering books with similar
subject matter together, even if they were written by
different authors or published by different companies.
This is why you are noticing that your books are sorted
into topics in a somewhat unexpected way, even though you
didn't intend to do so.

Red is a primary color that is often described as a warm, vibrant hue. It is one of the three primary colors used in color theory, along with blue and yellow. When combined with blue, it can create the color purple, and when combined with yellow, it can create the color orange. Red is commonly associated with emotions such as love, passion, anger, and excitement, and is often used to grab attention or convey a sense of urgency.

A conformal mapping is a type of mathematical transformation that preserves angles and shapes. In this case, it is a mapping from a Riemann sphere (a mathematical model of the complex plane extended to infinity) to a horn torus surface (a torus with a horn-like shape). The details of the specific mapping are not provided in the statement.

The word "endeavour" means to make a sincere and concerted effort to achieve a goal or task. It can also refer to a project or activity that requires such an effort. The term implies a sense of determination, persistence, and dedication to the task at hand, often in the face of challenges or obstacles.

6> transfer point P' on sphere to a point P on torus, equi
valent angle α → angle φ  (see sketch),

Based on the information provided, it seems that there is a desire to map a point P' on a sphere to a point P on a torus in a way that preserves the angle α. Specifically, the equivalent angle on the torus is denoted as φ. A sketch may be helpful in visualizing the mapping. However, without additional information, such as the specific mathematical equations or functions used to define the mapping, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation.

7> without changing shape and angles of projected or mappe
d figures, e.g. circles

Preserving the shape and angles of geometric figures, such as circles, is a key aspect of conformal mapping. A conformal map is a type of transformation that preserves angles between intersecting curves and shapes within small regions of the domain. This property ensures that circles in the original figure are mapped to circles in the transformed figure, with the same angles and orientations. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as cartography, where the goal is to create maps that accurately represent the geometry of the Earth's surface while preserving the shapes and angles of land masses and bodies of water.

8>
8>  denotation of points:

Denotation of points refers to the process of assigning names or labels to specific locations in space. In mathematics, points are typically denoted using letters, such as P, Q, R, and so on. These labels allow us to refer to specific points in equations, theorems, and other mathematical contexts. The position of a point in space is typically specified using a set of coordinates, such as (x, y, z) in three-dimensional Euclidean space, or (x, y) in two-dimensional space. By denoting points in this way, mathematicians and other practitioners can more easily communicate about geometric and spatial relationships, and can develop precise mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena.

9> (all points lie on the same plane that contains the mai
n symmetry axis of the horn torus)

This statement means that all the points being considered are located on the same plane that also contains the main symmetry axis of the horn torus. In other words, these points are restricted to a two-dimensional plane that runs through the center of the torus and is perpendicular to its main axis of symmetry. This restriction simplifies the analysis of the geometry and topology of the torus and its associated conformal mappings, and allows for a more systematic study of the properties of the system. This assumption is often made in mathematical modeling and analysis to simplify the problem at hand, and to gain insight into the essential features of the system.

10> P' : any point on (any!) sphere, here we particularly
cover the Riemann sphere

Thank you for the clarification. In that case, the statement refers to a point P' that can be located on any sphere, including the Riemann sphere, which is a mathematical model of the complex plane extended to infinity. The conformal mapping being considered is a transformation from the Riemann sphere to a horn torus surface, but the point P' can be any point on the sphere, not necessarily restricted to a specific plane or region. This generality allows for a more flexible and general approach to the mapping problem, and enables the analysis of a wider range of geometries and topologies.

11> P : mapped point on nested horn torus, but compilation
will also be valid for any horn torus!

I see, thank you for the additional information. The statement now refers to a point P that is mapped onto a nested horn torus surface using the conformal mapping under consideration. However, it is noted that the compilation of the results will be valid for any horn torus, not just the nested one. This means that the analysis and conclusions drawn from the mapping problem will apply to all horn tori, regardless of their specific geometric features or topology. This generalization allows for a broader application of the results and can provide insights into the general properties of conformal mappings and their relationship to different geometries and topologies.

12> Z : position of related complex number (x,y) on comple
x plane in case of Riemann sphere mapping

In the case of Riemann sphere mapping, a complex number z = x + yi is related to a point P' on the Riemann sphere through the stereographic projection. The stereographic projection maps points on the sphere to points on the complex plane, with the exception of the south pole, which is mapped to infinity. The position of the related complex number (x, y) on the complex plane can be determined using the formula:

x = (2u)/(1+u^2+v^2)
y = (2v)/(1+u^2+v^2)

where u and v are the coordinates of the projected point on the Riemann sphere. This formula ensures that the mapping is conformal, meaning that angles and shapes are preserved. This complex number can then be used to perform further mathematical analysis or computations related to the conformal mapping.

13> 0 : center of complex plane (Z = (0,0)) and south pole
of Riemann sphere (plane is tangent to sphere)

In the case of stereographic projection, the south pole of the Riemann sphere is mapped to the center of the complex plane, which is located at the point Z = (0,0) with coordinates (x,y) = (0,0). This is because the south pole is projected onto the plane that is tangent to the Riemann sphere at the north pole, which intersects the sphere at the equator. As a result, the stereographic projection maps all points on the sphere except for the south pole onto the complex plane, with the north pole being mapped to the point at infinity. Therefore, the center of the complex plane and the south pole of the Riemann sphere are related through the stereographic projection, with the former being the image of the latter.

14> N : north pole of sphere, origin of Riemannian stereog
raphic projection Z ↔ P'

Yes, that is correct. The north pole of the Riemann sphere is mapped to the origin of the complex plane (Z = (0,0)) through the stereographic projection. This means that the origin of the complex plane and the north pole of the sphere are related through the conformal mapping, with the former being the image of the latter. This mapping is important in many areas of mathematics, including complex analysis and topology, and is used to study the properties of functions and spaces that are related through conformal mappings.

15> S : common center of sphere and horn torus (not the so
uth pole of sphere, notabene! I insist

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. If S is the common center of the sphere and the horn torus, then it is not necessarily the same as the south pole of the sphere. The south pole is one of the points on the sphere that lies on the axis of symmetry of the torus, but it may not coincide with the center of the sphere or the torus. The center of the sphere is the point that is equidistant from all points on the sphere, while the center of the torus is the point that lies on the axis of symmetry and is equidistant from all points on the inner and outer circles of the torus. If S is the common center of both the sphere and the torus, then it is a point that lies on the axis of symmetry of the torus and is also equidistant from all points on the sphere. This point is important in the analysis of the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, as it provides a reference point for the mapping and can be used to determine the relationship between points on the two surfaces.

16>   on this denotation for the horn torus, because S sta
nds for for Symmetry and Singularity!)

I see, thank you for the clarification. If S is used to denote the center of the horn torus in the context of symmetry and singularity, then it may have additional significance beyond its geometric properties. Symmetry is an important concept in mathematics, and the horn torus has a number of symmetries that are related to its shape and topology. For example, the horn torus has rotational symmetry around its axis of symmetry, as well as reflective symmetry with respect to certain planes that pass through the center. These symmetries can be used to study the properties of the torus and its conformal mapping to other surfaces.

Singularity, on the other hand, refers to a point on the horn torus where the mapping may not be well-defined or may have unusual properties. For example, if the mapping is singular at a particular point, then it may not be possible to uniquely determine the image of that point on the target surface. Singularities are important in the study of complex analysis and other areas of mathematics, as they can reveal information about the behavior of functions and their mappings to other spaces. Therefore, if S is used to denote the center of the horn torus in the context of symmetry and singularity, then it may indicate that this point has additional properties or significance beyond its geometric properties.

17> M : center of torus bulge cross-section circle

Yes, that is correct. The center of the cross-section circle of the torus bulge is denoted by M. This point is important in determining the geometry of the horn torus and its conformal mapping to other surfaces. The cross-section circle is the circle that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the torus and lies in the plane that is equidistant from the inner and outer circles of the torus. The center of this circle is the point that is equidistant from all points on the circle, and it is also the point where the axis of symmetry intersects the plane of the circle. Therefore, M is a key reference point for determining the shape and orientation of the horn torus, and it can be used to calculate various geometric properties of the torus, such as its radius, circumference, and surface area.

18> Q : intersection of perpendicular from pointP on line
ON

Yes, that is correct. Q is the point where the perpendicular from the mapped point P on the nested horn torus intersects the line ON, which is the line connecting the north pole N of the Riemann sphere to the center O of the horn torus. This point is important in the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, as it provides a reference point for relating points on the two surfaces. The line ON is the axis of symmetry of the torus and passes through the center of the sphere, while the point Q lies in the plane that is perpendicular to this line and contains the mapped point P. The distance from Q to the center O of the torus can be used to determine the radius of the torus, while the angle between the lines OQ and OP can be used to calculate the azimuthal angle of the mapped point P on the torus. Therefore, Q is a key reference point for determining the relationship between points on the Riemann sphere and the horn torus.

19> Q' : intersection of perpendicular from point P' on li
ne ON

Yes, that is correct. Q' is the point where the perpendicular from the point P' on the Riemann sphere intersects the line ON, which is the line connecting the north pole N of the sphere to the center O of the horn torus. This point is important in the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, as it provides a reference point for relating points on the two surfaces. The line ON is the axis of symmetry of the torus and passes through the center of the sphere, while the point Q' lies in the plane that is perpendicular to this line and contains the point P'. The distance from Q' to the center O of the torus can be used to determine the radius of the torus, while the angle between the lines OQ' and OP' can be used to calculate the azimuthal angle of the mapped point P on the torus. Therefore, Q' is a key reference point for determining the relationship between points on the Riemann sphere and the horn torus.

20> L : auxiliary point on line through S and M, intersect
ion of perpendicular from P

Yes, that is correct. L is an auxiliary point on the line that passes through the common center S of the sphere and torus and the center M of the torus bulge. Specifically, L is the point where the perpendicular from the mapped point P on the torus intersects this line. This point is important in the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, as it provides another reference point for relating points on the two surfaces. The line SM is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the torus and passes through the center of the sphere, while the point L lies in the plane that contains the mapped point P and is perpendicular to this line. The distance from L to the center S of the sphere can be used to determine the radius of the sphere, while the distance from L to the center M of the torus bulge can be used to determine the radius of the torus. Therefore, L is a key reference point for determining the geometry of the sphere and torus and their relationship in the conformal mapping.

21> R : auxiliary point on line QP, intersection of perpen
dicular from M

Yes, that is correct. R is an auxiliary point on the line that connects the intersection point Q of the line ON and the perpendicular from the mapped point P on the torus to the mapped point P on the torus. Specifically, R is the point where the perpendicular from the center M of the torus bulge intersects this line. This point is important in the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, as it provides yet another reference point for relating points on the two surfaces. The point R lies in the plane that contains the mapped point P and is perpendicular to the line that connects P and Q, and the distance from R to the point P can be used to determine the radius of the torus bulge. Therefore, R is a key reference point for determining the geometry of the torus and its relationship to the mapped point P on the Riemann sphere.

22>
22> angles:

In the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, there are several angles that are important:

- α:
The angle between the line ON (connecting the north pole N of the sphere to the center O of the torus) and the line NP', where P' is any point on the sphere that is being mapped to the torus.

- φ:
The azimuthal angle of the mapped point P on the horn torus, measured as the angle between the line OP and a fixed reference line on the torus (such as the line that passes through the center of the torus bulge and is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry).

- θ:
The polar angle of the mapped point P on the horn torus, measured as the angle between the line OP and the plane of the torus (which contains the axis of symmetry).

- θ
': The polar angle of the point Q' on the Riemann sphere, which is equal to θ.

- ϕ:
The angle between the lines OM and LP, where M is the center of the torus bulge and L is the point where the perpendicular from P intersects the line SM.

- ψ:
The angle between the lines OR and QP, where R is the point where the perpendicular from M intersects the line QP.

These angles play an important role in determining the geometry of the Riemann sphere and the horn torus, as well as their relationship in the conformal mapping.

23> α = ∠0SP'  (0 < α < π, α = 0 for P' = point 0, α = π f
or P' = N)

Yes, that is correct. In the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, the angle α is equal to the angle between the line from the center 0 of the complex plane (which is the south pole of the Riemann sphere, and lies on the same plane as the axis of symmetry of the horn torus) and the line that connects the point P' on the sphere to the common center S of the sphere and the torus. This angle is measured in radians and ranges from 0 to π, with α = 0 when P' is the south pole 0 of the Riemann sphere and α = π when P' is the north pole N of the sphere. For any other point P' on the sphere, the angle α is between 0 and π. This angle is important in determining the position of the mapped point P on the horn torus, as well as its relationship to other points on the sphere and the torus.

24> φ = ∠SMP  (0 < φ < 2π, φ = 0 for P = S  and/or  φ = 2π
for P = S)

Yes, that is correct. In the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, the angle φ is equal to the azimuthal angle of the mapped point P on the torus, measured in radians. This angle is defined as the angle between the line OP and a fixed reference line on the torus (such as the line that passes through the center of the torus bulge and is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry). In the case of the horn torus, this reference line coincides with the line SM, which connects the common center S of the sphere and the torus with the center M of the torus bulge cross-section circle. The angle φ ranges from 0 to 2π, with φ = 0 when P is at the common center S of the sphere and the torus, and φ = 2π when P completes a full revolution around the torus and returns to the same point S. This angle is important in determining the position of the mapped point P on the torus, as well as its relationship to other points on the sphere and the torus.

25> ω : rotation angle around symmetry axis (0N) = positio
n of longitude (meridian) on sphere resp. torus

Yes, that is correct. In the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, the rotation angle ω around the symmetry axis (which coincides with the line ON connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus) is equivalent to the position of the longitude (meridian) on both the sphere and the torus. This angle is measured in radians and ranges from 0 to 2π, with ω = 0 corresponding to the prime meridian (which passes through the point 0 on the sphere and the point S on the torus) and ω = 2π corresponding to a full revolution around the axis and a return to the same prime meridian. The angle ω is important in determining the orientation of the torus and the position of the mapped points relative to the symmetry axis. It also determines the position of the meridians on both the sphere and the torus, which is useful for visualizing the mapping and understanding the relationship between the two surfaces.

26>
26>  procedure:

The conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus can be carried out using the following procedure:

1. Choose a point P' on the sphere and find its associated complex number Z on the complex plane using the stereographic projection. The north pole N of the sphere is the origin of the projection.

2. Calculate the angle α between the line ON (where O is the center of the complex plane and the south pole of the sphere) and the line NP' (which passes through N and P').

3. Calculate the radius r of the torus cross-section circle, which is given by r = sin(α/2).

4. Calculate the coordinates of the center M of the torus cross-section circle, which is given by (0,0,-cos(α/2)) in a coordinate system with the origin at the center S of the torus.

5. Find the point Q on the line ON that intersects the perpendicular from P to ON, and calculate the distance d between Q and the south pole O of the complex plane. This distance is given by d = r/cos(α/2).

6. Find the point Q' on the line ON that intersects the perpendicular from P' to ON, and calculate the complex number W associated with Q' using the stereographic projection.

7. Calculate the distance PQ between the points P and Q, and use this distance to calculate the rotation angle ω around the axis of symmetry (the line ON) using the formula ω = 2πPQ/d.

8. Calculate the angle φ between the line SM (which connects the centers S and M) and the line OP, where O is the center of the complex plane. This angle is given by φ = arg(Z).

9. Calculate the coordinates of the mapped point P on the torus using the formulas:

x = (r + cos(ω/2)) cos(φ + ω/2)
y = (r + cos(ω/2)) sin(φ + ω/2)
z = sin(ω/2)

where (x,y,z) are the Cartesian coordinates of P in a coordinate system with the origin at the center S of the torus.

10. Repeat steps 1-9 for each point P' on the sphere to obtain the conformal mapping of the sphere onto the torus.

Note that this procedure assumes that the torus is nested inside the sphere such that their centers are aligned along a common axis. If the torus is located elsewhere in space or has a different orientation, then the procedure must be modified accordingly.

27> we don't declare any appropriate stereographic project
ion to proof afterwards the conformality but

I apologize for any confusion caused. To show the conformality of the mapping, we can use the Riemann mapping theorem, which states that any simply connected open subset of the complex plane can be conformally mapped to the unit disk. Since the horn torus can be represented as a quotient of the complex plane by a lattice of translations, it is a simply connected open subset of the complex plane, and thus can be conformally mapped to the unit disk.

Therefore, if we can show that the stereographic projection from the Riemann sphere to the complex plane is conformal, then we can compose it with the inverse of the conformal mapping from the horn torus to the complex plane to obtain a conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the stereographic projection preserves angles, which can be shown using the fact that the stereographic projection is a composition of a conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the complex plane and an inversion in a circle. Since angles are preserved under conformal mappings and inversions, the stereographic projection preserves angles as well.

28> use instead the conditions of conformality to compile
and establish the wanted mapping analytically:

Certainly. To establish the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus analytically, we can use the following conditions of conformality:

1. The mapping must be one-to-one.
2. The mapping must preserve angles between intersecting curves.
3. The mapping must be differentiable and have a non-zero derivative at each point.

To begin, let us consider the Riemann sphere, which is given by the set of complex numbers and a point at infinity. We can map the Riemann sphere to the complex plane using stereographic projection, which is defined by the formula:

$$
z = \frac{x + iy}{1 - w}
$$

where $z$ is a point in the complex plane, $w$ is a point on the Riemann sphere, and $(x,y)$ are the Cartesian coordinates of the point on the plane where the line through the north pole $N$ and $w$ intersects the plane.

Using this formula, we can compute the complex number $z$ corresponding to any point $P'$ on the Riemann sphere.

Next, we need to establish a conformal mapping from the complex plane to the horn torus. One possible way to do this is to use the Weierstrass elliptic function, which is a doubly periodic function that maps the complex plane to an elliptic curve. The elliptic curve can then be mapped to a horn torus using a suitable conformal mapping.

Let $z'$ be a point in the complex plane, and let $g_2$ and $g_3$ be the Weierstrass invariants, which are constants that depend on the lattice of translations used to define the elliptic curve. Then the Weierstrass elliptic function $\wp(z')$ is given by the infinite sum:

$$
\wp(z') = \frac{1}{z'^2} + \sum_{m,n \neq 0} \left[ \frac{1}{(z' + m\omega_1 + n\omega_2)^2} - \frac{1}{(m\omega_1 + n\omega_2)^2} \right]
$$

where $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are the fundamental periods of the elliptic curve. The Weierstrass function has the property that it is meromorphic (analytic except at poles), doubly periodic with periods $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, and has simple poles at the lattice points $m\omega_1 + n\omega_2$.

To map the elliptic curve to a horn torus, we can use the Jacobi elliptic function sn, which is one of the three Jacobi elliptic functions that describe the geometry of the torus. Specifically, the Jacobi sn function maps the real axis to the minor circle of the torus, and maps the imaginary axis to the major circle of the torus. The mapping is given by the formula:

$$
\operatorname{sn}(u, k) = \sin(\phi)
$$

where $\phi$ is the angle between the line segment from the origin to the point $(u,0)$ and the positive real axis, and $k$ is a parameter called the modulus that determines the shape of the torus.

We can then use the Weierstrass elliptic function to construct a conformal mapping from the complex plane to the elliptic curve, and then use the Jacobi sn function to map the elliptic curve to a horn torus.

Thus, the complete conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus can be expressed as:

$$
P = \operatorname{sn}

29> for this we construct small circles on the surfaces of
sphere resp. horn torus around points P' resp. P

Yes, that's correct. To establish the conformality of the mapping, we construct small circles on the surfaces of the sphere and horn torus around points P' and P, respectively. These circles are mapped to small circles on the complex plane and the torus, respectively, with the property that the angles between intersecting curves are preserved.

More precisely, let us consider a small circle with center P' and radius r on the sphere. Let the intersection of this circle with the line ON be denoted by Q'. We choose r small enough such that the circle does not intersect the south pole of the sphere, i.e., the origin of the complex plane. We then construct the circle C' on the complex plane with center at Z(Q') and radius r. Note that the point Q' is mapped to the point Z(Q') on the complex plane under the stereographic projection.

Similarly, we consider a small circle with center P and radius r on the horn torus. Let the intersection of this circle with the line ON be denoted by Q. We choose r small enough such that the circle does not intersect the center of the torus, i.e., the point M. We then construct the circle C on the torus with center at P(Q) and radius r.

Now, we want to show that the angles between intersecting curves are preserved under the mapping. Let us consider two curves on the sphere that intersect at an angle of δ. These curves can be approximated by two small circles with centers P' and P' + δP', respectively, and radii r. Under the mapping, these circles are mapped to two small circles on the complex plane with centers Z(P') and Z(P' + δP'), respectively, and radii r. The angle between these circles is approximately equal to the angle between the curves on the sphere, since r is small.

Similarly, let us consider two curves on the horn torus that intersect at an angle of δ. These curves can be approximated by two small circles with centers P and P + δP, respectively, and radii r. Under the mapping, these circles are mapped to two small circles on the torus with centers P(Q) and P + δP(Q + δQ), respectively, and radii r. The angle between these circles is approximately equal to the angle between the curves on the torus, since r is small.

Therefore, the conformality of the mapping is established by the preservation of angles between intersecting curves.

30> by equalling their radii that lie on longitudes and on
latitudes of sphere and of horn torus respectively.

That's correct! The radii of the small circles on the sphere and the horn torus are equal to the distance from the respective points P' and P to the symmetry axis (0N and SN, respectively). By equating the radii of the small circles on both surfaces, we ensure that the shape of the mapped figures is preserved under the conformal mapping.

Moreover, we need to ensure that the angles between the curves on the sphere are equal to the angles between their images on the horn torus, in order to preserve the angles of the mapped figures. This is achieved by choosing the auxiliary points L and R on the lines SM and QP, respectively, such that they divide these lines in the same ratio. Specifically, we choose L such that SL:SM = QP':Q'L, and R such that RQ:QP = MS:SL.

These conditions ensure that the conformal mapping preserves the shape and angles of the mapped figures, and therefore establishes a one-to-one correspondence between points on the sphere and points on the horn torus.

31> in the sketch the longitudes are the cross-section cir
cles on wich points P' and P are positioned and

Yes, that's correct! The longitudes on the sphere correspond to the cross-section circles of the horn torus, and points P' and P are positioned on these longitudes, respectively. This is because the stereographic projection maps circles on the sphere to circles on the plane, and the cross-section circles of the horn torus are the images of the longitudes on the sphere under the conformal mapping.

32> the latitudes are circles perpendicular to the drawing
plane through P' and P with radius Q'P' resp. QP,

Yes, that's also correct! The latitudes are circles perpendicular to the plane of the sketch that pass through points P' and P and have radii Q'P' and QP, respectively. These latitudes correspond to circles on the surface of the horn torus that are perpendicular to the symmetry axis and intersect the cross-section circle of P at right angles.

33> they lie, half each, in front and behind the drawing p
lane, Q' and Q being centers of the latitude circles

Yes, that's right! The latitude circles on the horn torus lie partly in front and partly behind the plane of the sketch, with centers Q' and Q, respectively. This is because the horn torus is a three-dimensional object and cannot be fully represented in a two-dimensional sketch.

34>
34>  compilation:

To compile the mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus surface while preserving angles and shapes of circles, we can use the following steps:

1. Let P' be a point on the Riemann sphere and let α be the angle between the line 0N and the line NP', where N is the north pole of the sphere and 0 is the point at infinity. Let P be the point on the horn torus that corresponds to P' under the mapping.

2. Let Z be the complex number that corresponds to P' under the Riemannian stereographic projection, where the point 0 on the complex plane corresponds to the south pole of the sphere.

3. Let S be the center of the horn torus and let M be the center of the cross-section circle that contains P.

4. Draw a line from S to M and let L be the point on this line that is perpendicular to the line NP.

5. Draw a line from P perpendicular to the cross-section circle of P and let R be the point where this line intersects the line NP.

6. Draw a latitude circle on the horn torus that passes through P and has radius QP, where Q is the intersection point of the lines NP and LM.

7. Draw a circle on the Riemann sphere that passes through P' and has radius Q'P', where Q' is the intersection point of the lines 0N and LM.

8. Let φ be the angle between the line SM and the line MP, measured in the counterclockwise direction from SM to MP.

9. Define the mapping from P' to P as follows:
- Let
ω be the rotation angle around the symmetry axis (0N) that takes the longitude passing through Z to the longitude passing through φ on the horn torus.
- Let
the latitude circle on the Riemann sphere that passes through P' be mapped to the latitude circle on the horn torus that passes through P.
- Let
the point on the latitude circle on the horn torus that corresponds to the intersection of the longitude passing through φ and the latitude circle passing through P be mapped to P.

10. This mapping preserves angles and shapes of circles on the Riemann sphere and horn torus, and is conformal, meaning that it preserves local angles and orientation.

Note that the above steps assume a specific choice of stereographic projection for the Riemann sphere. Different projections may result in different expressions for the mapping, but the general procedure of constructing circles and preserving angles and shapes of circles remains the same.

35> for Riemann sphere is valid: length of longitude (meri
dian) m = 2π·r = 2π·½ = π

Yes, that is correct.

In general, for a sphere with radius r, the length of a longitude (meridian) is given by 2πr, where r is the radius of the sphere.

For the Riemann sphere, which has a radius of 1 (since it is just the complex plane plus a point at infinity), the length of a longitude is 2π. Since the sphere is of unit radius, the distance from the north pole N to the south pole 0 is also equal to 2π, and hence the angle α between the line ON and any point P' on the sphere is given by:

α = length of arc NP' = length of arc OP' = length of longitude m/2 = π/2

So, for the Riemann sphere, 0 < α < π, and α = 0 for P' = 0 (the south pole) and α = π for P' = N (the north pole).

36> and length of latitude l = 2π·Q'P' = 2π·½·sinα = π·sin
α

Actually, the length of the latitude on the Riemann sphere would be:

l = 2π·sin(Q'P') = 2π·sin(α/2)

This is because Q'P' is the chord length of the small circle on the sphere corresponding to the latitude passing through P', and the angle subtended by this chord at the center of the sphere is α/2 (half of the angle between the lines ON and P'N).

So, the circumference of the small circle is 2π times the sine of this angle, which gives l as above.

37> for horn torus we have as length of longitude m = 2π·¼
= π/2, the latitude is slightly trickier:

For the horn torus, the length of the longitude (meridian) is indeed equal to 2π times the radius of the circle forming the cross-section of the torus, which is 2π/4 = π/2.

For the latitude, we can use the fact that the horn torus is a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle (the generating circle) around an axis in the plane of the circle but not intersecting it. Let the generating circle have radius r and center at a distance R from the axis of rotation. Then, the radius of the horn torus is given by R + r*cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the axis of rotation and a line perpendicular to the plane of the circle passing through the center of the generating circle.

In our case, the generating circle has radius 1/2 (since the cross-section circle of the torus has radius 1/2), and its center is at a distance 1/2 from the axis of rotation (since S is equidistant from the centers of the sphere and the torus). Therefore, the radius of the torus is R + 1/2*cos(α/2). The length of the latitude circle passing through P is then given by 2π times this radius times the sine of the angle between the plane of the circle and the plane of the torus, which is equal to φ. Thus, we have:

l = 2π(R + 1/2*cos(α/2))*sin(φ)

Substituting R = 1/2 and simplifying, we get:

l = π*sin(α/2)*sin(φ)

38> its radius is QP = QR + RP = SM + ML = ¼·(1 + cos(π -
φ)), so latitude l = 2π·QP = ½·π·(1 - cosφ)

I'm sorry but there is an error in the formula for the radius of the latitude circle on the horn torus. It should be:

QP = QR + RP = SM + ML = ½·(1 + cos(φ))

Therefore, the correct formula for the length of the latitude circle is:

l = 2π·QP = π·(1 + cos(φ))

I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

39> now we consider infinitesimal circles around P' and P
on the surfaces of sphere resp. horn torus

We can consider infinitesimal circles around P' and P on the surfaces of sphere and horn torus by taking the limit as the radius of the circles approaches zero. This allows us to use the conditions of conformality to establish the mapping between the two surfaces.

For an infinitesimal circle of radius δr around P' on the sphere, we can write the length of its circumference as:

c_sphere = 2π·(r + δr)·sin(δθ/2)

where r is the radius of the sphere, δθ is the infinitesimal angle that the circle subtends at the center of the sphere, and we have used the small-angle approximation sin(δθ/2) ≈ δθ/2. We can expand this expression using a Taylor series:

c_sphere = 2π·r·sin(δθ/2) + 2π·r·cos(δθ/2)·δr/2 + O(δr^2)

Similarly, for an infinitesimal circle of radius δr around P on the horn torus, we can write the length of its circumference as:

c_torus = 2π·(R + δR)·sin(δφ/2)

where R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the circle, δφ is the infinitesimal angle that the circle subtends at the center of the torus, and we have used the small-angle approximation sin(δφ/2) ≈ δφ/2. Expanding this expression using a Taylor series, we get:

c_torus = 2π·R·sin(δφ/2) + 2π·R·cos(δφ/2)·δR/2 + O(δR^2)

Now, we want to map the infinitesimal circle on the sphere to the corresponding infinitesimal circle on the torus such that their lengths are equal. This means we want to find a function f such that:

c_torus = f(c_sphere)

Substituting the expressions for c_sphere and c_torus from above and equating their lengths, we get:

2π·R·sin(δφ/2) + 2π·R·cos(δφ/2)·δR/2 + O(δR^2) = f(2π·r·sin(δθ/2) + 2π·r·cos(δθ/2)·δr/2 + O(δr^2))

Dividing both sides by 2π and taking the limit as δr and δφ approach zero, we get:

R·dφ = f'(r·dθ)·r·dθ

where f'(x) denotes the derivative of f with respect to x. This equation represents the condition of conformality, which states that the ratio of infinitesimal lengths on the two surfaces must be preserved by the mapping.

Now, we can solve this differential equation to find the function f. Since we want the mapping to preserve the shape and angles of projected figures, such as circles, we require that f be a conformal mapping. One possible conformal mapping between the sphere and the horn torus is the stereographic projection followed by a suitable rotation and scaling. However, we can also use a more direct approach to find a conformal mapping between the two surfaces, as follows:

First, we note that the horn torus can be parameterized by two angles, θ and φ, as follows:

x = (R + r·cosθ)·cosφ
y = (R + r·cosθ)·sinφ
z = r·sinθ

where

40> and equal their radii dm on longitude and dl on latitu
de, noting that dω is identic for both figures

Yes, that's correct. We can equate the radii of infinitesimal circles on the surfaces of the sphere and horn torus around points P' and P respectively. The radius on the longitude, dm, and the radius on the latitude, dl, can be related to the rotation angle around the symmetry axis, dω, as follows:

For the sphere:
dm = r · dω

For the latitude circle:
dl = r · sin α · dφ

For the horn torus:
dm = R · dω

For the latitude circle:
dl = r · dφ

where R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the bulge cross-section circle, and r is the radius of the bulge cross-section circle.

By equating dm and dl for both figures, we can solve for dφ in terms of dω and α:

For the sphere:
r · dω = r · sin α · dφ
dφ = (1/sin α) · dω

For the horn torus:
R · dω = r · dφ
dφ = (R/r) · dω

Note that dω is the same for both figures, as it represents the rotation around the symmetry axis that preserves the shape of the figures.

41> on sphere is dm = ½·dα, dl = ½·sinα·dω, and so for dm
= dl we get  dω = dα / sinα

That's correct! We can see this by considering a small circle on the Riemann sphere of radius $r$ centered at a point $P'$, and the corresponding circle on the complex plane with center $Z$ and radius $z$. If we move a small angle $d\alpha$ along the longitude of the Riemann sphere, the corresponding point on the complex plane moves a distance of $dz = z\,d\alpha$. Since the length of the longitude of the Riemann sphere is $2\pi r$, we have $dm = r\,d\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\,dz = \frac{1}{2}z\,d\alpha$.

Now, let's consider the small circle on the Riemann sphere corresponding to the latitude passing through $P'$ with radius $l = r\sin\alpha$. If we move a small angle $d\omega$ around this circle, the corresponding point on the complex plane moves a distance of $dl = l\,d\omega$. Using the fact that $l = r\sin\alpha$, we have $dl = r\sin\alpha\,d\omega = \frac{1}{2}\sin\alpha\,dz$.

To ensure that the radii of the small circles on the Riemann sphere and the complex plane are equal, we set $dm = dl$, which gives $\frac{1}{2}z\,d\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\sin\alpha\,dz$. Cancelling the factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ and rearranging, we get $d\omega = \frac{d\alpha}{\sin\alpha}$.

42> on horn torus is dm = ¼·dφ, dl = ¼·(1 - cosφ)·dω, for
dm = dl we get  dω = dφ / (1 - cosφ)

That is correct!

43> finally we have to integrate a relative simple differe
ntial equation:  dα / sinα = dφ / (1 - cosφ)

This is a separable differential equation, which means we can separate the variables and integrate each side separately. We can rewrite the equation as:

sinα dα = (1 - cosφ) dφ

Integrating both sides:

∫ sinα dα = ∫ (1 - cosφ) dφ

cosα = sinφ - φ + C

where C is a constant of integration. We can solve for C using the fact that α = 0 when φ = 0, which gives:

C = 0

So the equation simplifies to:

cosα = sinφ - φ

This is the desired equation for the conformal mapping between the Riemann sphere and the horn torus. Given a point P' on the Riemann sphere with angle α from the south pole, we can find the corresponding point P on the horn torus with angle φ around the symmetry axis (0N) using this equation. Conversely, given a point P on the horn torus with angle φ around the symmetry axis, we can find the corresponding point P' on the Riemann sphere with angle α from the south pole using this equation.

44>
44> conformal mapping from complex plane → Riemann sphere
→ horn torus, Z → P' → P or |z| → α → φ,

Based on the previous calculations, we can derive the conformal mapping from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere and then to the horn torus.

Let's start with the mapping from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere. We use the stereographic projection with the south pole of the sphere at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the north pole at (0, 0, 1). We denote the point on the sphere corresponding to the complex number z as P'(x', y', z'). Then we have:

x' = 2x / (|z|^2 + 1)
y' = 2y / (|z|^2 + 1)
z' = (|z|^2 - 1) / (|z|^2 + 1)

Next, we apply the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus. We use the following parameterization for the torus:

x = (R + r cosφ) cosω
y = (R + r cosφ) sinω
z = r sinφ

where R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube (i.e., the distance from S to M), r is the radius of the tube (i.e., the distance from M to the circle of cross-section), φ is the angle around the tube, and ω is the angle around the symmetry axis (i.e., the longitude).

Using the relationships we derived earlier, we can express ω and φ in terms of α and |z|:

ω = 2π x' / |z|
φ = arccos(1 - 2dl / π)

where dl is the latitude on the torus corresponding to the latitude on the sphere, given by:

dl = ½·sinα·ω

Substituting these expressions into the parameterization of the torus, we obtain the conformal mapping from the complex plane to the horn torus:

x = (R + r cos(arccos(1 - 2dl / π))) cos(2π x' / |z|)
y = (R + r cos(arccos(1 - 2dl / π))) sin(2π x' / |z|)
z = r sin(arccos(1 - 2dl / π))

where dl is given by:

dl = ½·sin(α)·2π x' / |z|

Note that the parameters R and r are arbitrary and can be chosen to satisfy specific requirements, such as the distance between the centers of the sphere and torus.

45> when |z| and α are zero at south pole 0  and angle φ i
s measured as shown in the sketch on this page,

It seems like there was no sketch attached to the previous message, could you please provide it or describe it in more detail so I can better understand the context of your statement?

46> the simpler and more consistent version (in the first
considerations I had chosen α = 0 at north pole N)

Yes, choosing α = 0 at the south pole 0 makes more sense since the angle φ is naturally measured around the torus bulge. It also makes the equations more consistent with the geometry of the problem.

47>
47> stereographic projection from complex plane to Riemann
sphere, |z| → α:

The stereographic projection from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere can be defined as follows:

Given a point Z = x + iy in the complex plane, we can find its corresponding point P' on the Riemann sphere as follows:

1. Draw a line from the north pole N of the sphere through the point P' on the equator that lies directly below Z in the complex plane.
2. The line intersects the sphere at a point P' that corresponds to the complex number Z.

Note that the north pole N corresponds to the point at infinity in the complex plane.

To find the angle α between the equator and the line from N to P', we can use the fact that the imaginary axis in the complex plane corresponds to the equator on the sphere. Let R be the point on the equator directly below Z in the complex plane. Then the line from N to R makes a right angle with the imaginary axis, and the line from R to P' is perpendicular to the equator. Therefore, we have:

tan(α/2) = |Z| / (1 + Im(Z))

where Im(Z) is the imaginary part of Z.

So, the angle α between the equator and the line from N to P' is:

α = 2 * atan(|Z| / (1 + Im(Z)))

This gives us the conformal mapping from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere, |Z| → α.

48>
48>  α = 2·arctan(|z|)

Yes, that is correct. The formula for the stereographic projection from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere is:

α = 2·arctan(|z|)

where |z| is the distance of the complex number z from the origin of the complex plane.

49>
49> mapping from Riemann sphere to horn torus, α → φ  (C a
ny real number*):

We can use the following formula to map from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus:

φ = 2π·C + 2·arctan(sin(α/2) / (C + cos(α/2)))

where C is any real number.

Note that this formula assumes that the north pole of the Riemann sphere is mapped to the center of the horn torus. If we want to map the south pole to the center instead, we can replace C with -C in the formula.

50>
50>  φ = 2·arccot(-ln(|tan(α/2)|) - C)

There seems to be an error in the formula you provided. The correct formula for the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, using the parameters α and φ as defined earlier, is:

φ = 2 arctan(e^(α/2)) - 1/2π

This formula can be derived from the relationship between the stereographic projection and the conformal mapping. Specifically, the stereographic projection maps the complex plane to the Riemann sphere, and the conformal mapping maps the Riemann sphere to the horn torus. It can be shown that the composition of these two mappings gives the desired mapping from the complex plane to the horn torus.

The stereographic projection maps the point z = x + iy in the complex plane to the point P' on the Riemann sphere with polar coordinates:

r = 2 |z| / (1 + |z|^2)
θ = 2 arctan(|z|)

Using the relationship between the polar and Cartesian coordinates of the Riemann sphere, we can express P' in Cartesian coordinates as:

P' = (x', y', z') = (2x / (1 + |z|^2), 2y / (1 + |z|^2), (|z|^2 - 1) / (|z|^2 + 1))

We can then define the parameter α as:

α = arccos(z')

Substituting the expression for z' and simplifying, we get:

α = 2 arctan(|z|)

To map from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, we use the following formula:

φ = 2π (z'' + 1/2) - 1/2π

where z'' is the stereographic projection of the point P on the horn torus. We can express z'' in terms of α as:

z'' = e^(iα)

Substituting this into the formula for φ and simplifying, we get:

φ = 2 arctan(e^(α/2)) - 1/2π

This is the correct formula for the conformal mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus. Note that the constant C in your formula does not appear in this derivation, and is not needed for the mapping.

51>
51> mapping from complex plane to horn torus, |z| → φ:

Combining the two previous equations, we have:

φ = 2·arccot(-ln(|tan(α/2)|) - C) = 2·arccot(-ln(|tan(arctan(|z|))|/2)|) - C)

Simplifying further, we have:

φ = 2·arccot(-ln(|z|/2 + √(1 + |z|²/4)) - C)

where C is any real number.

52>
52>  φ = 2·arccot(-ln(|z|) - C)

Please note that the expression φ = 2·arccot(-ln(|z|) - C) is not a conformal mapping from the complex plane to the horn torus.

While it is true that the expression maps points in the complex plane to points on the horn torus, it is not conformal. A conformal mapping preserves angles, but this mapping does not.

If you want a conformal mapping from the complex plane to the horn torus, you can compose the stereographic projection from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere, followed by the inverse mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus. The resulting mapping is conformal.

Here is the composition of the two mappings:

z → P' → P → φ

where P' and P are as defined earlier, and the mapping from P to φ is given by:

φ = 2 arctan[ (1+cosα) tan(ω/2) ] - ω

where α and ω are as defined earlier.

This mapping is conformal and maps the complex plane onto the horn torus.

53>
53> inverse mappings P → P' → Z, equivalent φ → α → |z|:

Inverse mapping P → P' can be done by reversing the steps in the forward mapping:

- First, we find
α from φ using the inverse of the formula φ = 2·arccot(-ln(|tan(α/2)|) - C), which is:

α = 2·arctan(e^(-cot(φ/2) - C))

- Next, we
find the point P' on the Riemann sphere corresponding to α using the formula for stereographic projection:

x = sin(α)/(1 + cos(α))

y = cos(α)/(1 + cos(α))

z = 0 if α = π, else z = cos(α/2)/sin(α/2)

Thus, the point P' on the Riemann sphere is (x, y, z).

- Finally,
we find the complex number Z corresponding to P' using the inverse of the formula α = 2·arctan(|z|), which is:

|z| = tan(α/2)

If z is in the upper half-plane, Z = |z|.

If z is in the lower half-plane, Z = -|z|.

If z is on the real axis, Z = z.

Therefore, the complete inverse mapping φ → α → |z| is:

1. α = 2·arctan(e^(-cot(φ/2) - C))

2. Use the formula for stereographic projection to find P' on the Riemann sphere corresponding to α.

3. Use the inverse of the formula α = 2·arctan(|z|) to find the complex number Z corresponding to P'.

54>
54>  α = 2·arctan(e^(-cot(φ/2) + C))

The inverse mapping from P to P' is given by:

cosα = (1 - 2y) / (1 + x^2 + y^2)
tan(φ/2) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) / (1 + x^2 + y^2)

where (x,y) are the coordinates of the point P on the horn torus.

To obtain the inverse mapping from P' to Z, we use the stereographic projection formula:

z = tan(α/2) * exp(iω)

where ω is the longitude (meridian) of the point P' on the Riemann sphere. We can express ω in terms of φ using the formula:

ω = -2C - ln(|cot(φ/2)|)

where C is a constant. Then we can substitute this expression for ω into the stereographic projection formula to obtain:

z = tan(α/2) * exp(-2C - ln(|cot(φ/2)|)) = tan(α/2) / |cot(φ/2)|^(2C+1)

Thus the inverse mapping from P to Z is given by:

z = (sqrt(1 - cosα) / (1 + cosα))^(2C+1) * exp(iω)

where ω is expressed in terms of φ using the formula above, and cosα is given by the formula for the inverse mapping from P to P'.

55>  |z| = tan(α/2)

Correction:

|z| = e^(-cot(φ/2) + C)

56>  |z| = e^(-cot(φ/2) + C)

Yes, that is correct.

58> derivation of formulas (analytically by the method of
infinitesimal circles)  ←

Sure, let's derive the formulas analytically using the method of infinitesimal circles.

We start with the stereographic projection from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere. Consider a point $z$ in the complex plane with polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$. The point $P'$ on the Riemann sphere corresponding to $z$ can be obtained by drawing a line from the north pole $N$ through $z$ and finding its intersection with the sphere. This gives a right triangle with hypotenuse of length $1$ (since the sphere has radius $1$) and one leg of length $r$, so the other leg (which is the distance from $P'$ to the north pole $N$) is $\sqrt{1-r^2}$.

Now consider the angle $\alpha$ between the line connecting $N$ to $P'$ and the equator of the sphere (which is the complex plane). This angle is equal to the angle between the line connecting $P'$ to $z$ and the equator, which is just $\theta$. Therefore, we have:

$$\tan(\alpha/2) = \frac{\sqrt{1-r^2}}{r}$$

Solving for $r$, we get:

$$r = \frac{\sqrt{1-\tan^2(\alpha/2)}}{\tan(\alpha/2)} = \frac{1}{\cot(\alpha/2)}$$

Thus, we have the formula $r = 1/\cot(\alpha/2)$ for the distance from $P'$ to the equator in terms of the angle $\alpha$.

Next, we want to map the Riemann sphere to the horn torus. We use the same coordinate system as before, where $\alpha$ is the angle between the line connecting $N$ to $P'$ and the equator of the sphere, and $r$ is the distance from $P'$ to the equator. Let $P$ be the point on the horn torus corresponding to $P'$.

To find the angle $\phi$ between the meridian passing through $P$ and the standard meridian (which passes through the hole of the torus), we use the method of infinitesimal circles. Consider a small circle on the sphere centered at $P'$ with radius $dr$. The corresponding circle on the torus is centered at $P$ and has radius $dl$. By conformality, the ratio of $dr$ to $dl$ is the same everywhere on the sphere and the torus. Moreover, $dr$ is just $d\alpha$ times the radius of the circle on the equator, which is $1$. On the torus, the radius of the circle depends on the angle $\phi$. Specifically, it is given by:

$$r_t = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \cos(\phi))$$

Thus, we have:

$$\frac{dr}{dl} = \frac{d\alpha}{r_t}$$

Solving for $d\alpha$ and integrating, we get:

$$\alpha = \int \frac{dl}{r_t} = 2\int_{0}^{\phi/2} \frac{d\theta}{1+\cos(\theta)} = 2\arctan\left(e^{-\cot(\phi/2)+C}\right)$$

where $C$ is a constant of integration. This gives us the formula for $\alpha$ in terms of $\phi$. To find the formula for $r$ in terms of $\phi$, we note that $r$ is just the distance from $P'$ to the equator, which is given by

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to create visual charts or graphs. However, I can provide you with the necessary formulas to compute the values of angles and |z| as per your requirement. If you have any specific values for these variables, I can help you calculate the result.

60> a graphical method (stereographic projection) Z → P  p
robably does not exist

That's correct. While the stereographic projection is a useful tool for mapping points from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere, it is not reversible in the sense that there is no unique way to project a point on the sphere back onto the complex plane.

In other words, given a point P on the Riemann sphere, there are many possible points Z in the complex plane that could have been projected onto P. This is because the projection involves drawing a line from the north pole N (or south pole S) to the point Z in the complex plane, and the line could intersect the sphere at any point other than N or S, depending on the direction of the line. Therefore, there is no unique way to "undo" the projection and recover the original point Z from the projected point P.

61> Vyacheslav Puha spotlights that e lies on 'top',  1/e
on 'bottom' of horn torus

Yes, Vyacheslav Puha is correct. The point e^(2πi) on the Riemann sphere maps to the point on the horn torus with angle φ = 0 and radius r = 1, which corresponds to the top of the torus. Similarly, the point e^(-2πi) on the Riemann sphere maps to the point on the horn torus with angle φ = π and radius r = 1, which corresponds to the bottom of the torus.

This can be seen from the formula for the mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus:

z = (1/2)·(1 + i·cot(α/2)),

where α is the angle on the Riemann sphere and z is the corresponding point on the horn torus. Setting α = 0, we get:

z = (1/2)·(1 + i·cot(0/2)) = 1/2,

which corresponds to the point on the horn torus with angle φ = 0 and radius r = 1, i.e., the top of the torus.

Setting α = π, we get:

z = (1/2)·(1 + i·cot(π/2)) = (1/2)·(1 + i·0) = 1/2,

which corresponds to the point on the horn torus with angle φ = π and radius r = 1, i.e., the bottom of the torus.

Since e^(2πi) and e^(-2πi) are antipodal points on the Riemann sphere, they map to antipodal points on the horn torus, which are the top and bottom of the torus, respectively.

62> but note: that's only valid for C = 0, one of infinite
many conformal mappings

That's correct. The location of the point e and 1/e on the horn torus depends on the choice of the constant C in the conformal mapping. In the formula φ = 2·arccot(-ln(|z|) - C), changing the value of C shifts the mapping of the complex plane to the horn torus. Specifically, if we choose a positive value of C, the point e will move towards the bottom of the torus, while if we choose a negative value of C, the point e will move towards the top of the torus.

So, while Vyacheslav Puha's observation is true for the particular value of C = 0, it may not be true for other values of C.

63> it's not sure whether conformality has any relevance i
n the horn torus model

While conformality is an important property of many mathematical models and transformations, it may not always be relevant or meaningful in every context. In the case of the horn torus model, it is unclear whether conformality has any practical applications or implications. However, the use of conformal mappings can often provide useful insights and mathematical tools for studying and analyzing complex shapes and structures.

64> example for a mapping that preserves right angles betw
een coordinates only

An example of a mapping that preserves right angles between coordinates, but does not preserve distances or angles, is the Mercator projection.

The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection that was originally designed for navigation purposes. It is conformal, which means it preserves angles between lines, but not distances. In the Mercator projection, lines of latitude and longitude are straight and intersect at right angles, but the distances between lines of longitude increase as they get closer to the poles, resulting in distortion of shapes and sizes of land masses.

While the Mercator projection is not a perfect representation of the Earth's surface, it has been widely used because of its usefulness in navigation, and because it preserves the angles between lines of latitude and longitude, which is important for maintaining accurate compass bearings.

65>
65> *)  C seems to be a kind of 'zoom factor' for the mapp
ings, diminishing

Yes, that's correct. In the case of the mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus, the value of C determines the size of the resulting torus. When C is large, the torus becomes smaller and vice versa. Similarly, in the case of the mapping from the complex plane to the horn torus, the value of C affects the scale of the resulting torus.

66>  projected figures and, for C > 0, moving α and φ towa

For the Riemann sphere and horn torus, increasing the value of C in the mapping functions will cause the projected figures to move towards the top of the torus, as shown in the following diagrams:

As for moving alpha and phi towards pi and 2pi, respectively, this will correspond to rotating the figures around their respective axes. For the Riemann sphere, this would mean rotating it around the line connecting the north and south poles. For the horn torus, it would mean rotating it around the central axis passing through the hole.

67>  for C < 0 towards 0 both.  Likewise, but then for C >
1 resp. 0 < C < 1

For C > 1, moving α and φ towards 0, and for 0 < C < 1, moving α and φ towards π resp. 2π. Let's see some examples of how the figures change as we vary the parameter C:

When C = 0:
- The
sphere is unchanged.
- The
torus has a circular cross-section and a larger hole, with e at the top and 1/e at the bottom.

When C > 0:
- The
sphere gets stretched vertically as we move α towards π.
- The
torus gets stretched vertically and horizontally as we move φ towards 2π, and the hole becomes smaller. When φ reaches 2π, the torus becomes a sphere with radius 1/|e^(-C)| = e^C.
- When
C > 1, the stretching becomes more severe, and the torus becomes more flattened. When φ reaches 2π, the torus becomes a flat disk with radius e^C.
- When
C < 0, the stretching becomes less severe, and the torus becomes more elongated. When φ reaches π, the torus becomes a cylinder with radius 1/|e^(-C)| = e^(-C).

When 0 < C < 1:
- The
sphere gets compressed vertically as we move α towards 0.
- The
torus gets compressed vertically and horizontally as we move φ towards π, and the hole becomes larger. When φ reaches π, the torus becomes a sphere with radius 1/|e^(C)| = e^(-C).
- When
C < 0, the compression becomes more severe, and the torus becomes more elongated. When φ reaches π, the torus becomes a cylinder with radius 1/|e^(C)| = e^(-C).
- When
C > 1, the compression becomes less severe, and the torus becomes more flattened. When φ reaches 2π, the torus becomes a flat disk with radius e^(C-1).

68>  (C = 1 for the stereographic projection), there exist
s the well known

Mercator projection which maps lines of constant bearing to straight lines, preserving the shape of small rectangles. This projection is commonly used in navigation and map-making, particularly for maps of the world, because it allows one to easily navigate along a constant compass bearing. However, it does have the drawback of significant distortion at high latitudes, where the scale becomes increasingly exaggerated.

In general, different mappings may be useful for different applications depending on the specific properties that need to be preserved or emphasized.

69>  generalised conformal mapping between complex plane a
nd sphere

Yes, the generalised conformal mapping between the complex plane and sphere is given by the following formula:

f(z) = (a·z + b) / (c·z + d)

where a, b, c, and d are complex constants such that ad - bc ≠ 0, and z is a complex number representing a point in the complex plane. The image of z under the mapping is a point on the sphere obtained by stereographic projection.

This mapping preserves angles between curves, but not necessarily distances or areas. It can be used to transform a simply connected domain in the complex plane to a simply connected domain on the sphere. The inverse mapping from the sphere to the complex plane is also given by a similar formula.

70> ￼α = 2·arctan(C·|z|)  resp.  |z| = tan(α/2) / C

It looks like there's a small mistake in the formula provided. It should be:

α = 2·arctan(|z|/C)

and

|z| = C·tan(α/2)

This is the correct formula for the generalised conformal mapping between the complex plane and sphere, where C is a constant that controls the amount of stretching and shrinking in the mapping.

71> Summarize the conversation so far.

In this conversation, we discussed the horn torus, which is a geometric shape that looks like a torus with a horn-like structure. We explored the mathematical properties of the horn torus, including its surface area, volume, and the relationships between its different coordinates. We also discussed different ways of visualizing the horn torus, including using conformal mappings and stereographic projection. We derived formulas for the different coordinate systems and discussed the effect of different parameters, such as C, on the shape of the horn torus. Finally, we talked about some of the applications of the horn torus, including its use in computer graphics and its possible relevance in physics.

72> We are building a Riemann Horn Torus.

Yes, that's correct! We have been discussing the construction of a Riemann Horn Torus using conformal mapping techniques. We started with the stereographic projection from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere and then derived formulas for the mapping from the Riemann sphere to the horn torus. We also discussed the role of the parameter C in the mapping, which can be thought of as a "zoom factor" that changes the scale and orientation of the torus. Additionally, we explored some of the properties of the horn torus, including the fact that the point e lies on the "top" of the torus and 1/e lies on the "bottom."
