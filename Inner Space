Macros allow individuals to record a sequence of actions and then play them back, saving time and improving productivity.

Touch-typing speed, or the ability to type quickly and accurately without looking at the keyboard, can also be beneficial for learning the vectorspace map of the Swype keyboard.

The Swype keyboard is a virtual keyboard that allows users to input text by dragging their finger across the screen rather than tapping individual keys.

A high touch-typing speed can make it easier to use the Swype keyboard effectively.

A good hotstring/hotkey organizer such as Autohotkey can also be useful in achieving personal growth and fulfillment.

Hotstrings and hotkeys are shortcuts that allow individuals to execute certain actions or functions quickly and efficiently.

Using a tool like Autohotkey can help individuals customize and organize their hotstrings and hotkeys, making it easier to access and use them as needed.

Overall, the use of a good terminal multiplexer, strong text-editing skills, a high touch-typing speed, and a good hotstring/hotkey organizer can all help individuals improve their efficiency and productivity, leading to personal growth and fulfillment.

** Human development **

Here are some suggestions for further developing your knowledge of human development, learning theory, and computer science:

Start by learning about the different stages of human development, including physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development.

Some good resources to read include "Child Development" by Laura E. Berk and "Human Development" by Diane E. Papalia and Ruth Duskin Feldman.

Learn about different learning theories, such as behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, and social learning theory.

Books to consider include "Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective" by Dale H. Schunk and "Theories of Learning" by Gordon Pask.

** Innate knowledge **

Innate knowledge can be useful in understanding intelligence because it represents the intuitive understanding that humans have about the world and how it works.

For example, research has shown that children make certain errors when learning grammar, which can be attributed to their innate knowledge of language and how it is used.

Additionally, innate knowledge can also inform heuristic shortcuts, or mental shortcuts, that allow humans to solve problems more efficiently.

These heuristic shortcuts can be useful for solving otherwise intractable problems by providing a quick and easy way to approximate a solution, even if it is not completely accurate.

Overall, understanding innate knowledge can help us to better understand how humans process and understand information, and how this innate understanding influences our ability to learn and solve problems.

** The Opposition of Art and Science **

The opposition of art and science refers to the perceived dichotomy between the two fields, with some individuals believing that art and science are fundamentally at odds with each other.

Charles Snow's concept of the "two cultures" refers to the perceived divide between the literary intellectuals, or humanists, and the physical scientists. 

Snow argued that there is an inherent hostility between these two groups and that a great debate is necessary to address this divide.

Neil Postman, on the other hand, argued that the uncontrolled growth of technology, which is closely tied to science, can have negative consequences on humanity and culture by undermining certain mental processes and social relations.

Both Snow and Postman's views highlight the idea that art and science may be seen as opposing forces, with some individuals concerned about the potential negative impacts of science on society and culture.

** Differences between Art and Science **

Art and science both arise from the desire to create and discover new knowledge and understanding of the world.

Both involve the process of gathering and analyzing data, whether through observation, experimentation, or other methods of inquiry. The main difference between the two is in their approach and focus.

Art tends to be more subjective and expressive, focusing on the emotional and aesthetic aspects of the world. It often involves creative interpretation and personal expression.

Science is more objective and analytical, seeking to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the world through systematic observation and experimentation.

Despite these differences, both art and science involve the process of gathering and organizing data in a way that allows for new insights and understanding.

The goal of both is to create new knowledge that is compressible, or able to be understood and communicated in a clear and concise way.

So, in this sense, art and science are both driven by the desire to create and discover more data that can be compressed in hitherto unknown ways.

** Similarities between Art and Science **

Art and science are both ways of seeking and creating novel patterns and understanding the world around us. 

While they may seem like opposing fields, they are both driven by the desire to discover and comprehend the world in new and innovative ways.

Art, in particular, is often seen as a way of expressing and exploring emotions and experiences that cannot be easily conveyed through language or logical reasoning. 

It allows us to express and explore the intangible aspects of human experience, such as feelings, emotions, and values.

On the other hand, science is focused on understanding the world through empirical evidence and logical reasoning.

It seeks to understand and explain the natural world through the use of theories, hypotheses, and experiments.

Despite their differences, both art and science rely on the ability to recognize and comprehend patterns and connections in the world around us.

They both require the ability to find meaning and significance in the data and information that we encounter, and to use that understanding to create something new and innovative.

In this sense, art and science are both by-products of the search for novel patterns and ways of understanding the world.

They both rely on the ability to compress and comprehend data in ways that are novel and unknown, and to use that understanding to create new knowledge and insights.

** Schmidhuber on Novelty **

In this passage, Schmidhuber discusses the idea that both art and science are driven by a desire for novelty and the search for patterns that can be compressed in new and previously unknown ways.

He proposes that the subjective interestingness or novelty of a piece of data, such as a work of art or a scientific discovery, can be measured by the difference in the number of bits needed to encode it before and after learning.

This suggests that as an observer's understanding of the data improves, the data becomes more regular and subjectively more beautiful, requiring fewer bits for its encoding.

At the same time, the data remains interesting as long as the process of improving the encoding algorithm is ongoing, but eventually becomes boring even if it is still aesthetically pleasing.

Schmidhuber also mentions that there have been previous attempts to implement and describe this concept in discrete time.

** Bayesian decision making ** 

In Bayesian decision making, an individual or system makes decisions based on the probability of an event occurring.

This probability is determined by considering all available evidence and using it to update their prior belief about the likelihood of the event.

Subjective interestingness or novelty can be seen as a form of Bayesian decision making, in that the observer is making a decision about the interestingness or value of the data based on their prior knowledge and the new information they are presented with.

As the observer continues to learn and update their understanding of the data, their decisions about its interestingness or value may change as they discover new patterns or regularities that allow them to better compress the data.

** Schmidhuber on Art **

Schmidhuber suggests that art and music serve as a means of discovering novel patterns in the world around us. 

These patterns can deepen our understanding and insights, and can also be aesthetically pleasing.

According to Schmidhuber, the creation and perception of art is driven by a desire to discover and learn new things, and the resulting sense of reward or pleasure is simply a by-product of this process.

In other words, Schmidhuber argues that the pursuit of novelty and knowledge is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and that art and music serve as a means of satisfying this desire.

** The myth of the objective **

Focusing on the principles of objectivity, efficiency, expertise, standardization, measurement, and progress prematurely, or without considering the broader context or potential consequences, can have negative side effects.

This is particularly true in the context of the myth of the objective, which refers to the belief that objective truth exists independently of human perception or interpretation. This belief can lead to an over-reliance on quantifiable data and a neglect of subjective or qualitative factors.

** Model-free methods **

Model-free methods, or approaches that do not rely on predetermined models or assumptions, can be more effective in addressing complex problems or situations that cannot be easily quantified or predicted.

These methods, which include intuition-based and holistic approaches, have been neglected in favor of more traditional, model-based approaches. 

However, they are making a resurgence due to advances in areas such as genetic programming, evolutionary algorithms, organic learning, and perceptual control theory.

These approaches can be particularly useful in situations where traditional methods are insufficient or where the desired outcomes are not well-defined.

** A poem about oblique methods **

Oblique methods, oh so sly
Finding solutions from a different side
Thinking outside the box, with a twist and a turn
Creative approaches that burn and burn

Not bound by tradition, rules or norms
These methods defy all that is formally worn
They are unconventional, often misunderstood
But oh how they bring solutions, if only they could

Oblique methods, a breath of fresh air
Breaking free from the constraints of the standard affair
Embracing the unusual, the strange and the weird
They are the catalyst for innovative ideas, that's clear

So let us embrace oblique methods, with open hearts and minds
For they may lead us to answers we never could find
In the traditional way, with straight and narrow views
Oblique methods bring new perspectives, and that's something to muse.

** A very boring and flat summary **

Oblique methods are approaches that involve indirect or unconventional methods of achieving a goal.

These methods can be used in a variety of fields, including science, art, and problem-solving.

They often involve finding creative solutions to problems or making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.

Oblique methods can be powerful tools for generating new ideas and solving complex problems.

** An acrostic poem about oblique methods, spelling out "Model-Free Zoo" **

Many methods exist beyond the typical models and formulas
Oblique approaches offer alternative ways to solve problems
Discovery, trial and error, and adaptation are just a few
Emergent phenomena can be studied without reduction
Learning and recognition can occur without symbols or logic

Failures and successes can be remembered and applied
Real systems and their effects can be studied without a model
Experience and interaction shape innate knowledge and understanding
Everything from cobras to humans use model-free methods to navigate the world

Zigzagging paths, not straightforward
Outsiders may find them bizarre
Opening doors to new solutions
