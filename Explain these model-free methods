Trial-and-error (also known as generate-and-test) is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves attempting different solutions to a problem and evaluating the effectiveness of each solution.

This method can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including simple tasks such as finding a lost object or more complex tasks such as developing a new technology or product.

Enumeration is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves systematically listing out all the possible solutions to a problem and evaluating each one to determine the best option. This method is often used to solve problems with a limited number of possible solutions, such as finding all the possible combinations of a combination lock.

Remembering failures is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves recalling past failures and using that knowledge to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. This method can be used to improve decision-making and problem-solving skills by helping individuals learn from their past experiences.

Remembering successes is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves recalling past successes and using that knowledge to guide decision-making and problem-solving in the present. This method can be used to build confidence and improve problem-solving skills by helping individuals learn from their past successes.

Table lookup is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves consulting a pre-determined table of values to find the solution to a problem. This method is often used to solve simple problems or to perform basic calculations quickly and efficiently.

Mindless copying is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves simply copying the actions of others without understanding the underlying principles or reasoning behind them. This method can be useful for quickly solving simple problems or learning new tasks, but it may not be effective for solving more complex or novel problems.

Discovery is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves actively exploring and experimenting to find new solutions to problems. This method is often used in scientific research and can involve the use of trial-and-error, experimentation, and other model-free methods.

Recognition is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves identifying a problem or solution by comparing it to previously encountered problems or solutions. This method is often used in areas such as pattern recognition, object identification, and natural language processing.

Learning is a model-free method of problem-solving that involves actively acquiring new knowledge and skills through experience, training, or education. This method is often used to improve problem-solving skills.

Abstraction is a model-free method that involves simplifying a complex concept or process by focusing on its essential characteristics and ignoring or discarding non-essential details. This allows us to understand and manipulate the concept or process more easily.

For example, we use abstraction when we use the concept of "number" to represent quantities, even though the specific quantities we are working with may be different in nature (e.g., the number of apples and the number of people).

Abstraction is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and is essential for our ability to deal with the complexity of the world around us.

Adaptation is the process of changing or adapting to new or different circumstances. It can involve modifying behavior, characteristics, or processes in response to new conditions or environments.

Evolution refers to the gradual process of change and development that occurs in living organisms over time. It is driven by natural selection, which is the process by which certain traits or characteristics are passed down from one generation to the next because they help the organism survive and reproduce in its environment.

Narrative refers to the telling of a story or the recounting of events. It is a way of communicating information or experiences through the use of storytelling techniques, such as plot, character development, and setting.

Consultation is the act of seeking advice or expert opinion from someone else, typically in order to make a decision or solve a problem.

Delegation is the act of assigning responsibility or authority to someone else. It involves transferring tasks or decision-making authority to another person or group in order to accomplish a goal or achieve a desired outcome.

Markets are economic systems that involve the exchange of goods and services between buyers and sellers.

They can be physical locations, such as a traditional marketplace or shopping center, or virtual spaces, such as online platforms for buying and selling goods.

Markets operate based on supply and demand, with prices being determined by the interactions between buyers and sellers.

Intuition: Intuition is the ability to make quick and accurate judgments or decisions based on experience or instinct. It is a type of model-free method because it does not rely on specific models or algorithms to make decisions. Instead, it relies on the individual's past experiences and knowledge to guide their decision-making process.

Analogy: Analogy is the process of comparing two things in order to understand one of them better. It is a model-free method because it does not rely on specific models or algorithms to make comparisons.

Instead, it relies on the individual's ability to identify similarities and differences between two things in order to draw conclusions about them.

Heuristics: Heuristics are mental shortcuts that allow individuals to make judgments or decisions quickly and efficiently. They are model-free methods because they do not rely on specific models or algorithms to make decisions. Instead, they rely on the individual's past experiences and knowledge to guide their decision-making process.

Experience-based learning: Experience-based learning is a type of model-free method that relies on the individual's past experiences to guide their decision-making process. It does not rely on specific models or algorithms, but rather on the individual's ability to learn from their experiences and apply that learning to new situations.

Common sense: Common sense is the ability to make judgments or decisions based on what is generally considered to be reasonable or practical. It is a model-free method because it does not rely on specific models or algorithms to make decisions. Instead, it relies on the individual's general knowledge and understanding of the world to guide their decision-making process.
