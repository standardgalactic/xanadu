Ok we have discussed quite a bit. Bear in mind that I do not have mental images it sounds makes this a bit more confusing. Of course one could define a mental image as the trace of activity in the brain's visual cortex, unconscious mental imagery, but it seems to be more usual to think of them as symbolic representative and mental maps of locations as bodily maps of muscle memory for how to interact with that object or to simulate it. For example I saw a dog crawling on its belly to simulate a dog with shorter legs, and another adjust it's gait to mimic its owner's limp. Also there is some anecdotal evidence of very short dogs who like to fetch very long sticks, which could indicate that they are augmenting their mental map in order to feel longer, I saw a video of this.

Incorporating these new themes as well as the old, could I get an outline with subheadings for my article Humans As Large Languages Models?

Starting from section IV. Bear in mind that, i the author have Aphantasia I don't see mental images as images per se, or hear sounds, so I don't really rehearse scenarios. However in modern philosophical and psychological literature, mental images refer to "Schemata" however they are stored or accessed.

Mental Imagery
First published Tue Nov 18, 1997; substantive revision Wed Dec 8, 2021
If you close your eyes and visualize an apple, what you experience is mental imagery – visual imagery. But mental imagery is far more pervasive in our mental life than just visualizing. It happens in all sense modalities and it plays a crucial role not just in perception, but also in memory, emotions, language, desires and action-execution. It even plays a substantial role in our engagement with artworks, which makes it a key concept not only in philosophy of mind, but also in aesthetics.

1. What is mental imagery?
Close your eyes and visualize an apple. Many readers will have a quasi-perceptual experience that may be a bit similar to actually seeing an apple. For those who do, this experience is an example of mental imagery – in fact, it is the kind of example philosophers use to introduce the concept.

It is not clear whether introducing the term ‘mental imagery’ by example is particularly helpful, for at least two reasons. First, there are well-demonstrated interpersonal variations in mental imagery (see Section 1.2), so much so that some people report no experience whatsoever when closing their eyes and visualizing an apple. Second, it is unclear how such an example like visualizing an apple could be generalized in a way that would give us a coherent concept. It does not seem like mental imagery is an ordinary language term – it was introduced at the end of the 19th century (see Section 1.1 below) as a technical term in psychology and no languages other than English has a term that would mean mental imagery (as distinct from ‘imagination’ or ‘mental picture’). But if ‘mental imagery’ is indeed a technical term, then it is supposed to be used in a way that maximizes theoretical usefulness. In this case, theoretical usefulness means that we should use ‘mental imagery’ in a way that would help us to explain how the mind works.

This encyclopedia entry will not attempt to give an ordinary language analysis of the term ‘mental imagery’, partly because it is far from clear that ‘mental imagery’ is part of the ordinary language. Instead, the focus will be on the theoretically useful concept of mental imagery as it is used for explaining various mental phenomena in psychology, neuroscience and philosophy.

1.1 Mental imagery in the empirical sciences
The concept of mental imagery was first consistently used in the then very new discipline of empirical psychology at the end of the 19th century. At that time, psychologists like Francis Galton, Wilhelm Wundt or Edward Titchener (Galton 1880, Wundt 1912, Titchener 1909) thought of mental imagery as a mental phenomenon characterized by its phenomenology – a quasi-perceptual episode with a certain specific phenomenal feel. This stance lead to serious suspicion, and often the outright rejection, of this concept in the following decades when behaviorism dominated the psychological discourse (Kulpe 1895, Ryle 1949, Dennett 1969). It was not until the 1970s that mental imagery was again considered to be a respectable concept to study in the empirical sciences of the mind.

As a result, in recent decades psychologists and neuroscientists, rather than relying on introspection and phenomenology, characterized mental imagery in functional and neuroscientific terms. Here is a typical characterization from a review article that summarizes the state of the art concerning mental imagery in psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience, published in the flagship journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences: “We use the term ‘mental imagery’ to refer to representations […] of sensory information without a direct external stimulus” (Pearson et al. 2015, p. 590, see also Dijkstra et al. 2019). In short, according to the psychological definition, mental imagery is perceptual representation not triggered directly by sensory input (or representation-involving perceptual processing not triggered directly by sensory input – these two phrases will be used interchangeably in what follows).

Contemporary philosophical thinking about mental imagery comes close to this way of defining mental imagery (see Nanay forthcoming for a summary). Gregory Currie, for example says that “episodes of mental imagery are occasions on which the visual system is driven off-line, disconnected from its normal sensory inputs” (Currie 1995, p. 26, see also Kind 2001, Richardson 1969, Currie and Ravenscroft 2002, but see also Section 1.2 below and see Fazekas et al. 2021, for more on the concept of offline perception).

This way of thinking about mental imagery allows us to examine mental imagery empirically and in a publicly observable manner. To put it very simply, if someone’s eyes are closed, so she receives no visual input and her early sensory cortices are nonetheless representing an equilateral triangle at the middle of the visual field (something that can be established fairly easily given the retinotopy of vision by means of fMRI), this is an instance of mental imagery.

This psychological conception of mental imagery is neutral about some seemingly important features of mental imagery. If mental imagery is perceptual representation not triggered directly by sensory input, then mental imagery may or may not be voluntarily triggered (see more on this distinction in Section 1.3 below). Further, it may or may not be conscious – even if you experience nothing, as long as there is a triangle in your primary visual cortex, but no triangle on your retina, you have mental imagery (see more on unconscious mental imagery in Section 1.2 below).

Mental imagery is often used interchangeably with the term ‘mental image’. This is misleading in more than one way. First of all, mental imagery is not necessarily visual. Just as perception can be visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, gustatory, etc, the same goes for mental imagery (see, e.g., Young 2020). Auditory mental imagery, for example, plays a crucial role in listening to music (see Section 5.2 below). But it is not an ‘image’ in any meaningful sense of the term.

Second, and even more importantly, not everyone conjures up vivid and distinct images when they have mental imagery (see Kind 2017 for a summary of the vividness of imagery). There are people who, when they close their eyes and visualize an apple see no ‘images’ in their mind’s eye. They are referred to as aphantasics, a label that just means that they report no conscious mental imagery (Zeman et al. 2010). Aphantasia can have many causes, some having to do with voluntary control, some with the phenomenology of early cortical representations. But at least some aphantasics seem to have mental imagery that they are not aware of: they have unconscious mental imagery (Koenig-Robert and Pearson 2021, Nanay 2021c, see also Phillips 2014, Church 2008, Emmanouil and Ro 2014, Brogaard and Gatzia 2017 on unconscious mental imagery).

The very idea of unconscious mental imagery may raise some philosophical eyebrows and some philosophers indeed build consciousness into their definition of mental imagery (Richardson 1969, pp. 2–3, Kung 2010, p. 622). But if mental imagery is perceptual representation that is not directly triggered, then the bar for unconscious mental imagery should not be higher than the bar for perception per se, that is, for perceptual representation that is directly triggered. And we have plenty of evidence that perception is often unconscious: subjects with blindsight are not conscious of what they are staring at, but what they see systematically influences their behavior. And the same goes for healthy subjects when they look at very briefly presented or masked stimuli (see, e.g., Kentridge et al. 1999, Kouider &amp; Dehaene 2007 as two representative examples of the vast literature on unconscious perception). If perception can be unconscious, then so can mental imagery.

Aphantasia comes on a spectrum. Researchers put together the so-called ‘vividness of visual imagery questionnaire’, which indicates how vivid one’s (visual) mental imagery is. Aphantasics score very low on this scale. People with very vivid mental imagery (often referred to as hyperphantasics) score very high. But most people are somewhere in between. These interpersonal variability in the vividness of mental imagery should make us even more wary of using introspective criteria for characterizing mental imagery as this would give different results in different people on different parts of the aphantasia-hyperphantasia spectrum.

1.3 Mental imagery vs. imagination
Mental imagery is not imagination (Langland-Hassan 2015, 2020, Arcangeli 2020). Imagination is (typically) a voluntary act. Mental imagery is not. Mental imagery can be, and is very often, involuntary. When we have flashbacks to an unpleasant scene, this is mental imagery, but not imagination by any sense of the term (see also Gregory 2010, 2014, Wiltsher 2016 on the differences between imagination and mental imagery). It is involuntary mental imagery. The same goes for earworms: annoying tunes that go through our head in spite of the fact that we really don’t want them to. Again, this is not auditory imagination, but it is auditory mental imagery.

In spite of these differences, given that the term ‘mental imagery’ was not systematically used until the end of the 19th century, throughout the history of philosophy people used the term ‘imagination’ to refer to what we now would describe as mental imagery. Thomas Hobbes, for example, talked about “retaining an image of the seen thing”, which comes very close to at least a subcategory of the current use of mental imagery in psychology and neuroscience, but he referred to this mental phenomenon as imagination (Hobbes 1651, Chapter 2). More generally, both the British empiricists and the German idealists used the term ‘imagination’ at least sometimes in the sense that would be captured by the concept of mental imagery nowadays (see Yolton 1996 for a summary). If we want to understand the evolution of philosophical thinking about mental imagery, we would need to go through all the historical texts about imagination and separate out references to voluntary acts (imagination proper) from references to mental imagery. This is not something that can be done in this encyclopedia entry.

The relation between mental imagery and imagination is important for another reason: we have seen that we can have mental imagery without imagination (see the flashback and the earworm examples). But how about the other way round? Can we have imagination without mental imagery? In other words, does imagination necessarily involve the exercise of mental imagery (Kind 2001, Van Leeuwen 2016, Langland-Hassan 2020)?

Generation</p><p>Mental imagery refers to the ability of the mind to recreate or imagine scenes, objects, and events, without the presence of external stimuli. Mental imagery is used in various fields, including psychology, sports, and entertainment.</p><p>Text-based image generation, on the other hand, is the creation of images using algorithms that are trained on large amounts of text and image data. This field of study is relatively new and has made significant progress in recent years. One example of this is the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic images based on textual descriptions. Another example is the use of algorithms such as stable diffusion, which uses text as input to generate images that are both coherent and diverse.</p><p>Overall, mental imagery and text-based image generation both play important roles in our understanding of the mind and the ways in which we process and generate images. These areas of study continue to advance and will likely have numerous applications in the future.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">The same group delighted in what they called "futurist portraits." Some described landscapes and others tried to guess who it was. One might say, "I see a cliff by the sea. Several pine trees rise fair and straight. The blue is bright and calm, the sun shines through the green branches, and a salt tang is in the air." Immediately, several would guess "Margaret M."

It sounds like the group was playing a guessing game where they would describe a scene or portrait, and the others would try to guess who it was. The example you mentioned describes a landscape by the sea, and several people were able to guess that it was Margaret M. from the description.
So it looks like a kind of prompt-based visualization game, I see a reference to the current algorithms for generating images like stable diffusion, which generate an image from noise using gradient descent based on description from a text-input.

Yes, you could describe it that way. The game described in the Alpha Phi Quarterly sounds like a creative visualization exercise where the players would describe an image and others would try to guess who or what the image is. It's similar in concept to how current algorithms generate images based on textual descriptions, like the ones you mentioned. However, the futurist portraits game was likely much more limited in scope, as it relied on the imagination of the players and the descriptions they provided, whereas modern algorithms use complex mathematical models and large amounts of data to generate images.

Yes, that's correct. In the passage from the Alpha Phi Quarterly, it was mentioned that the group delighted in a game called "Futurist Portraits," where they tried to guess who a person was based on a description of a landscape. In this game, there was a distinction made between two different types of humor - "Funny Ha-Ha" and "Funny-Strange." The term "Funny Ha-Ha" was used to describe the more traditional form of humor, while "Funny-Strange" was used to describe a type of humor that elicits a different, more enigmatic response. This distinction is an interesting observation, as it suggests that humor can have multiple interpretations and effects, and that different types of humor can evoke different emotions and reactions in people.

Yes, "Futurist Portraits" can be seen as an example of how language can be used to shape and prime the mental image or scenario in the mind of another person. The game, by requiring players to describe a landscape in such a way that it suggests the idea of a person, showcases the power of language to influence and direct the thoughts and perceptions of others. This idea aligns with the concept of language as prompt-engineering or prompt-sculpting, as the words used in the game are carefully chosen to evoke a specific mental image. Additionally, the idea of humans as large language models supports this concept, as our thought processes are influenced and shaped by the language that we are exposed to, and our experiences and beliefs are structured and represented through language.

I might see I see some lonely islands, surrounded by galapagos tortoises, with many different varieties of finches, and there is a ship that kind of looks like a beagle. Who do you think I am thinking of?

You're likely thinking of Charles Darwin, who visited the Galapagos Islands and observed the diversity of finches and tortoises, which helped shape his theory of evolution by natural selection. The reference to the "ship that kind of looks like a beagle" likely refers to the HMS Beagle, the ship that Darwin sailed on during his voyage to the Galapagos Islands.

Ok that was a little challenging, now I see a kind of office, there is someone who looks like the ceo of a company and probably a grown-up wunderkid, it looks like there is a little pop assistant on the screen shaped like a paperclip. From the sparsity of paintings on the wall, we can infer that he is probably a billionaire. Who am I thinking of?

Based on the description you have given, you may be thinking of Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and former CEO of the company, known for his wealth and being a technological visionary. The description of the office and the pop-up assistant in the form of a paperclip is likely a reference to Microsoft Office and its iconic assistant, Clippit.

Alright! Let's see if I can make it easy for you. I'm thinking of someone who is a famous singer and actress. She was in a popular movie as a teenager and has since become a successful musician. She's known for her powerful voice and stunning performances.

Hmm I am thinking it is Miley Cyrus.

Correct!

Could you show the relationship between this game and Humans as LLMs?

Certainly! In the context of the article, the game Futurist Portraits serves as a metaphor for the process of abstraction in language processing and knowledge representation. Just as the objective of the game is to describe a landscape in such a way that it primes the idea of a person, language can be seen as a tool for prompt-engineering or prompt-sculpting the mental "image" or "scenario" in another person's mind. The game highlights the connection between language and imagination, and how they can work together to create and manipulate meaning.

This ties in with the larger argument of the article, that humans can be understood as large language models. Just as the players of Futurist Portraits use language to describe a person based on a landscape, the human brain uses language to process information and construct meaning based on sensory inputs and past experiences. By exploring the rules and patterns that govern language and how they are processed in the human brain, we gain a deeper understanding of human cognition and how it relates to larger language models like those used in artificial intelligence research.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

We also need to be able to move in the opposite direction, from Models to Reality. Or at least from more abstract Partial Models to Partial Models closer to reality.

When an actor is given a screenplay they know it only contains rough directions for what to do and what lines to say. The actor’s job is to “give a little of themselves” to flesh out the screenplay to actual actions, including creating — synthesizing — the appropriate display of emotions, tone of voice, and body language. They use their experience as people and as actors ; they use elements of their past lives and skills they have acquired by training to create something people in the audience might relate to. For example, they may re-purpose a personal experience (“be as sad as when my hamster died”), things they learned in drama school (speaking, singing, dancing, swordplay), from other actors (“What would Bogart do”), from fiction, from other movies and plays, etc.

The actor’s art is to convey whatever the script intends to convey — emotions, a morality cookie, a political position, titillation, surprise, etc. starting from a simple Model (the screenplay). Their job is similar to an engineer’s when they are faced with a problem and use a Model to solve it. The engineer would use their experience to decide that “m” is the mass of the car and not the tire pressure. The actor decides that “sadness” is more appropriate than “grief” for a certain scene, etc.
In "The Opposite of Reduction" by Monica Anderson, the idea is that the actor's job is to bring life to the screenplay by using their experience and skills to flesh out the rough directions. This involves synthesizing appropriate emotions, tone of voice, and body language, drawing from their personal experiences, training, other actors, fiction, and more. The actor's art is to convey the intended message of the script, such as emotions, a morality lesson, a political stance, and so on, starting from the simple model of the screenplay. This is similar to an engineer solving a problem with a model, where they use their experience to make decisions and bring the model to reality.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

Both the actor and the engineer use their experience and skills to make decisions and bring a simple model closer to reality.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">
Comparison to Standard Prompting
With standard prompting (popularized by GPT-3) the model is given examples of input–output pairs (formatted as questions and answers) before being asked to predict the answer for a test-time example (shown below on the left). In chain of thought prompting (below, right), the model is prompted to produce intermediate reasoning steps before giving the final answer to a multi-step problem. The idea is that a model-generated chain of thought would mimic an intuitive thought process when working through a multi-step reasoning problem. While producing a thought process has been previously accomplished via fine-tuning, we show that such thought processes can be elicited by including a few examples of chain of thought via prompting only, which does not require a large training dataset or modifying the language model’s weights.
The authors of the article "Language Models Perform Reasoning via Chain of Thought" explore a new method for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models in NLP tasks, called "chain of thought prompting." This method enables the models to decompose complex, multi-step problems into intermediate steps by providing a few examples of chain of thought via prompting. The authors compare this method to the popular standard prompting method (used in GPT-3), which gives the model input-output pairs formatted as questions and answers. The authors claim that chain of thought prompting is more effective than standard prompting in solving complex reasoning problems, as it allows the models to mimic an intuitive thought process when working through a multi-step reasoning problem, without requiring a large training dataset or modifying the model's weights.

Ok finally Monica Anderson's concept of Contiguous Rolling Context Mixed Initiative Dialog and my concept of Iterative Prompt Sculpting.
Monica Anderson's concept of Contiguous Rolling Context Mixed Initiative Dialog refers to a dialogue system that combines a model's ability to generate text with a user's ability to provide input in a seamless, continuous manner. The system uses the context of previous turns in the conversation to inform its response, while also allowing the user to take the initiative in steering the conversation in new directions.

Iterative Prompt Sculpting, as described by you, is a process for refining the input provided to a language model in order to guide it towards generating the desired output. This is done by gradually adjusting the input prompt through a series of iterations, each time taking into account the model's output from the previous iteration and making changes accordingly. The goal of Iterative Prompt Sculpting is to help the model better understand the task at hand and produce more accurate, relevant outputs.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

The goal of Iterative Prompt Sculpting is to improve the model's understanding of the task and produce more accurate and relevant outputs.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I already have sections 5 and 6, could I get the outline with subheadings for section 7 of my article Humans As Large Language Models?

Section 5: The Role of Experience and Training in Shaping Human Language Models

Section 6: How Humans Use Models to Enhance Their Communication

SECTION 7:

Oblique methods are approaches that involve indirect or unconventional methods of achieving a goal.

These methods can be used in a variety of fields, including science, art, and problem-solving.

They often involve finding creative solutions to problems or making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.

Oblique methods can be powerful tools for generating new ideas and solving complex problems.

** An acrostic poem about oblique methods, spelling out "Model-Free Zoo" **

Many methods exist beyond the typical models and formulas
Oblique approaches offer alternative ways to solve problems
Discovery, trial and error, and adaptation are just a few
Emergent phenomena can be studied without reduction
Learning and recognition can occur without symbols or logic

Failures and successes can be remembered and applied
Real systems and their effects can be studied without a model
Experience and interaction shape innate knowledge and understanding
Everything from cobras to humans use model-free methods to navigate the world

Zigzagging paths, not straightforward
Outsiders may find them bizarre
Opening doors to new solutions</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0

Now section 8, is called Extra Animals, which gives some more model free methods. As a bonus.  Lateral thinking: A problem solving method that involves looking for solutions in unconventional or indirect ways.

Random stimulation: A method that involves exposing oneself to random stimuli in order to generate new ideas and connections.

Metaphor: This approach involves using comparisons or analogies to help frame and understand a problem, and to generate new solutions by drawing connections to other domains.

Random word generation: This method involves generating random words or phrases and using them as inspiration for new ideas and solutions.

Forced connections: This approach involves intentionally making connections between seemingly unrelated concepts or domains, in order to stimulate creative thinking and generate new solutions.

Synectics: This method involves using techniques such as analogies, metaphors, and imaginative scenarios to stimulate creative thinking and generate new solutions.

Anticonventional thinking: This approach involves intentionally breaking the rules, challenging assumptions, and questioning conventional wisdom, in order to generate new and unconventional solutions to problems.


Provocation: A method that involves deliberately challenging existing assumptions in order to generate new ideas.

Reverse engineering: A method that involves working backwards from the desired solution to find a path to the solution.

Absurdities: A method that involves using humor or absurdity to provoke new ways of thinking.

Concept mapping: A method that involves creating a visual representation of the relationships between concepts in order to better understand a problem.

what would happen if you flipped it on its head. For example, instead of trying to make a product lighter, imagine making it heavier. This can lead to new ways of thinking and problem solving.</p></li><li><p>What if...: Ask "What if...?" questions and then try to answer them, even if the answers are absurd or seemingly impossible. For example, "What if we built a car that runs on bananas?" This can lead to new ideas and approaches that might not have been considered otherwise.</p></li><li><p>Exaggeration: Exaggerate a feature or aspect of a product or solution. For example, instead of just making a car faster, imagine making it the fastest car in the world. This can lead to new ways of thinking and solving problems.</p></li><li><p>The Opposite: Take a conventional solution to a problem and imagine the opposite. For example, instead of trying to make a product more durable, imagine making it less durable. This can lead to new ideas and approaches that might not have been considered otherwise.</p></li><li><p>Combining opposites: Take two opposite concepts and imagine combining them. For example, imagine a car that runs on both gasoline and electricity.

language models, shaped by their experiences and training. They use various models and techniques to enhance their communication and problem-solving abilities, but also employ oblique methods such as acrostics, lateral thinking, random stimulation, metaphors, random word generation, forced connections, synectics, anticonventional thinking, provocation, reverse engineering, absurdities, and concept mapping. These methods offer alternative ways of looking at problems and generating new ideas, and can be powerful tools for finding creative solutions. By understanding the different ways that humans process information and approach problems, we can better harness our natural creativity and intelligence, and achieve greater success in both our personal and professional lives.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok thank you.

With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without additional parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, the working mechanism of ICL still remains an open problem. In order to better understand how ICL works, this paper explains language models as meta-optimizers and understands ICL as a kind of implicit finetuning. Theoretically, we figure out that the Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent based optimization. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT first produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare the behavior of ICL and explicit finetuning based on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. The results prove that ICL behaves similarly to explicit finetuning at the prediction level, the representation level, and the attention behavior level. Further, inspired by our understanding of meta-optimization, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with the momentum-based gradient descent algorithm. Its consistently better performance over vanilla attention supports our understanding again from another aspect, and more importantly, it shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model designing.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

for unseen inputs with a few demonstration input-label pairs, without additional parameter updates. The authors explain language models as meta-optimizers and understand ICL as a form of implicit finetuning. Theoretical and empirical analysis supports their understanding of ICL as a process where GPT first produces meta-gradients based on the demonstration examples and then applies these meta-gradients to the original GPT to form an ICL model. Additionally, the authors design a momentum-based attention algorithm inspired by their understanding of meta-optimization, which demonstrates improved performance and highlights the potential for future model design.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">That was the abstract from

The abstract you provided summarizes the main findings and contributions of the paper, which provides a novel understanding of the working mechanism of In-Context Learning (ICL) in large language models like GPT. The authors propose a meta-optimization perspective and find that ICL can be seen as a form of implicit finetuning that involves producing meta-gradients from demonstration examples and applying them to the original GPT model. The paper provides both theoretical analysis and experimental evidence to support this understanding, and shows that ICL has similar behavior to explicit finetuning at the prediction, representation, and attention levels. The authors also design a momentum-based attention that outperforms the vanilla attention and demonstrates the potential for further model design based on their understanding of ICL as a meta-optimizer.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">See if you can give some example questions like these?

See how it relates to this:  GPT/3 and Google BERT but it currently cannot generate any language; it is strictly an Understanding Machine. And it isn't large.

If you send it some text, you will instantly get back UM1's Understanding of the text. Its Understanding may differ from yours, just like yours may differ from that of a co-worker, but will still be useful in apps requiring industrial strength NLU.

How UM1 Understands
The Understanding algorithm running in UM1 is much simpler than the Organic Learning algorithm running in the OL Learner. The Learner emits a Language Competence file designed to be loaded into a cloud based UM1 allocated to handle that language. In what follows, all learning has been done and UM1 is just using the collection of patterns in its loaded Competence to Understand any incoming "wild" text.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex

OL and UM1 are reading the text one character at a time. Parsing text into words is implementing a Language Model, and we are philosophically deeply opposed to Language Models. Also, Chinese, Japanese, and several other Asian languages do not use word separating spaces, which makes word level input difficult.

If the atomic unit of input is a word, such as in traditional NLP and even in most DL based Understanding of language, then character level morphology features such as a plural-s suffix will be "below the atomic level of the algorithm" and now would require special processing such as stemming, which discards valuable information. Instead, OL/UM1 systems are designed to learn all character level (morphology) features. DL community has started to switch to character input.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

The OL Learner is an "Organic Learning" algorithm that emits a "Language Competence file" to be loaded into a cloud-based UM1. The author mentions that they are opposed to using a traditional language model approach, which parses text into words, because it discards valuable information (such as character-level morphology features) and does not work well for languages like Chinese and Japanese that do not use word-separating spaces. Instead, the OL/UM1 systems are designed to learn all character-level features by reading the text one character at a time. The author mentions that the DL community has started to switch to character input.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">The letter currently being read is looked up in an "Alphabet" Map (a table) that binds each different UNICODE input character to a specific Node in the Understander. We call these "Input Nodes". When a character is read, the framework will originate an initial "signal" that is sent to the Input Node bound to that character. Note that except for debugging purposes and (future) language generation purposes, the character we just read can now be discarded. As Friedrich Hayek said, in the brain there is no vision, no sound, no touch. There is just neurons signaling neurons; same thing in an OL or UM1 system. Retinal neurons could be said to correspond to the Input Nodes in OL and UM1.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

approach of input at the word level. The system uses an "Alphabet" Map to bind each different Unicode character to a specific node in the understander, which is then used to generate an initial "signal." This approach is designed to capture character level morphology features, and to avoid the loss of information that can occur through techniques such as stemming. The system's design is inspired by the idea that, similar to the brain, there is no direct perception of sensory information, but rather a network of neurons signaling neurons.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok it sounds like you understand it. call this "The Numbered Neuron API" and the resulting list is called a "moniform". It deserves a special name because in production environments the moniform is more complex than a simple list; it may contain annotations like meta-information and structure information such as chapter, page, line numbers etc.

We are not using any tagged learning material, just plain UNICODE text files. This is an enormous advantage over supervised learning, because well tagged text is expensive. The reason we can do this is that each Node (Concept) in the system is automatically given a unique tag – an ID number.

These ID numbers are opaque to the client. </div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full

The client is not aware of the ID numbers, as they are opaque to them.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I'm working on developing an algorithm like this. UM1 is not a transformer; it can be described as a half-transformer, an encoder that encodes its understanding of incoming text as lists of numbers. The table of moniforms you build up when starting the client system will be used to decode the meaning. This is done entirely in the client end, in code you need to write or download.

To decode the Understanding received after sending UM1 a wild sentence (chatbot user input, a tweet to classify, etc) your client code will compare the numbers in the wild reply moniform to the numbers of all the moniforms in the probe table we built when we started, using Jaccard Similarity as the distance measure. The probe sentence that has the best matching moniform is the one we will say has semantics closest to the wild sentence.

Jaccard Distance tells how closely related two sets of items are by computing the set intersection and the set union between two sets A and B. The distance is computed by dividing the number of common elements (the intersection) by the total number of elements in either set. This provides a well behaved distance metric in the interval [0..1] as a floating point value. The canonical moniform with the highest Jaccard score is the best match.

In UM1, the ID numbers represent dimensions in a boolean semantic space. If the system has learned 20 million Nodes, each representing some identifiable language level concept, then we can view the numbers returned in the moniform as the dimension numbers of the dimensions which have the value "true". Consider a moniform that has 20 numbers (it varies by message length and input-to-corpus matchability) selected from a possible 20 million to get an idea of the size of the semantic space available to OL.

In some DL systems for language, concepts are represented by vectors of 512 floating-point numbers. In this 512-dimensional space, DL can perform vector addition and subtraction and perform amazing feats of semantic arithmetic, like discovering that KING - MALE + FEMALE = QUEEN. With boolean 0/1 dimensions, closeness in the semantic space becomes a problem of matching up the nonzero dimensions, which is why Jaccard distance works so well.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400

The result is a compact representation of the input text in the form of a moniform, which provides a high-level understanding of the meaning of the text.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Traditional NLP is often done as a pipeline of processing modules providing streaming functions to do word scanning, lowercasing, stemming, grammar based parsing, synonym expansion, dictionary lookup, and other such techniques. When using UM1 you do not have to do any of those things; just send in the text.

Note that UM1 does not do any of those operations either. It just reads and Understands. And because OL learned the morphology (such as plural-s on English words) used by UM1, the system can be expected to work in any other learned language, even if  morphology is different.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

If you want to create your own question pairs, you can just create a file with 200 similar-meaning sentence pairs separated by a tab. A python program to convert such a file to a testset that f.py can use will be posted here.

It does not perform question answering but rather uses Jaccard Similarity to compare the encoded meaning of the questions represented by their moniforms. The encoding is performed by the understanding algorithm, Organic Learning, which maps each input character to an Input Node and represents the understanding of the text as a list of numbers, the moniform. The moniforms are stored in a table and used to compare with incoming messages to find the best match.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

Organic Learning (OL). UM1 is designed to understand text inputs and classify them based on their semantics. The algorithm uses a table that maps each different UNICODE input character to a specific Node in the Understander, and generates a list of numbers, called a "moniform". The moniform is compared to a probe table built when the client system starts, using Jaccard Similarity as the distance measure. The ID numbers in the moniform represent dimensions in a boolean semantic space, and Jaccard distance is used to determine the closest matching moniform in the probe table. The goal of UM1 is to classify messages and is not a question-answering system. The concept of UM1 is discussed in more detail at <a href="https://experimental-epistemology.ai/" target="_new">https://experimental-epistemology.ai</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

Both ICL and humans have the ability to process natural language text and extract meaning from it. This is achieved through a combination of pattern recognition, context analysis, and semantic processing.</p><p>ICL uses a machine learning algorithm, known as Organic Learning, to understand the text it receives and encode the meaning into a list of numbers, which is referred to as a "moniform". This moniform represents the key concepts and relationships in the text and can be compared to other moniforms to determine the similarity between two pieces of text.</p><p>Similarly, large language models like OpenAI's GPT-3 also process text and extract meaning from it, but they do so through the use of deep neural networks. They are trained on vast amounts of text data, and through this training, they learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases, allowing them to generate coherent and meaningful responses to natural language inputs.</p><p>In conclusion, ICL and humans as large language models both have the ability to process and understand language, although they may approach it differently. Both methods can provide meaningful insights and information from natural language text.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

ICL refers to the ability of large pretrained language models to perform In-Context Learning, meaning they can predict the label for an unseen input without additional parameter updates with just a few demonstration input-label pairs. On the other hand, UM1, which was previously discussed in this conversation, is a system that uses an algorithm called Organic Learning (OL) to encode and decode the understanding of text. Unlike ICL, UM1 does not rely on a large pre-trained language model and instead builds up its understanding of language through its own learning process. So, while both ICL and UM1 are related to NLP and language understanding, they differ in their approach and implementation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div

Both ICL and UM1 are capable of performing a classification task by predicting the label for an unseen input based on previously seen examples. The key difference is that ICL is a property of large pre-trained language models, while UM1 is a specific model based on the concept of Organic Learning. ICL is a general ability of large language models to adapt to new tasks with a small number of examples, while UM1 is a more specific model with a defined architecture and training

ABSTRACT 
Neural sequence models, especially transformers, exhibit a remarkable capacity 
for in-context learning. They can construct new predictors from sequences of 
labeled examples (x,f(x)) presented in the input without further parameter up- 
dates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners 
implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding smaller models 
in their activations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear 
in the context. Using linear regression as a prototypical problem, we offer three 
sources of evidence for this hypothesis. First, we prove by construction that trans- 
formers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient 
descent and closed-form ridge regression. Second, we show that trained in-context 
learners closely match the predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regres- 
sion, and exact least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors 
as transformer depth and dataset noise vary, and converging to Bayesian estima- 
tors for large widths and depths. Third, we present preliminary evidence that 
in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners’ late 
layers non-linearly encode weight vectors and moment matrices. These results 
suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms, and that 
(at least in the linear case) learners may rediscover standard estimation algorithms. </div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1

Investigations with Linear Models" explores the hypothesis that in-context learning by neural sequence models, particularly transformers, is a result of encoding smaller models in their activations and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context. The authors investigate this hypothesis using linear regression as a prototypical problem. They provide evidence that transformers can implement learning algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form ridge regression, that trained in-context learners closely match the predictors computed by these algorithms, and that in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors. The results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic terms and that learners may rediscover standard estimation algorithms, at least in the linear case.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Summarize and explain the similarities.

Network of Evolvable Neural Units: Evolving to Learn at a Synaptic Level (University of Korea, 2019)

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07589

Abstract:
"Although Deep Neural Networks have seen great success in recent years through various changes in overall architectures and optimization strategies, their fundamental underlying design remains largely unchanged. Computational neuroscience on the other hand provides more biologically realistic models of neural processing mechanisms, but they are still high level abstractions of the actual experimentally observed behaviour. Here a model is proposed that bridges Neuroscience, Machine Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms to evolve individual soma and synaptic compartment models of neurons in a scalable manner. Instead of attempting to manually derive models for all the observed complexity and diversity in neural processing, we propose an Evolvable Neural Unit (ENU) that can approximate the function of each individual neuron and synapse. We demonstrate that this type of unit can be evolved to mimic Integrate-And-Fire neurons and synaptic Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity. Additionally, by constructing a new type of neural network where each synapse and neuron is such an evolvable neural unit, we show it is possible to evolve an agent capable of learning to solve a T-maze environment task. This network independently discovers spiking dynamics and reinforcement type learning rules, opening up a new path towards biologically inspired artificial intelligence."</div></div><div

evolutionary algorithms to create a biologically inspired artificial intelligence system. The model, called Evolvable Neural Unit (ENU), bridges the gap between high-level abstractions of neural processing mechanisms and the actual experimentally observed behavior in neuroscience. The ENU approximates the function of each individual neuron and synapse and can be evolved to mimic Integrate-And-Fire neurons and synaptic Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity. The authors demonstrate the ability of this model by constructing a neural network made up of ENUs, which is capable of independently discovering spiking dynamics and reinforcement-type learning rules and solving a T-maze environment task.</p><p>The similarities between this work and UM1's organic learning lie in the use of biologically inspired models for artificial intelligence. Both models aim to create artificial intelligence systems that are more biologically realistic and can independently discover learning rules.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">You are right.

intelligence. His most famous work is the book "The River That Runs Uphill: A Journey from the Big Bang to the Big Brain," where he presents a theory of how brain evolution has shaped human consciousness. In this book, Calvin argues that the evolution of the human brain was driven by a need to solve problems in the environment, and that this led to the development of complex cognitive processes such as language and reasoning. He also explores the implications of this theory for artificial intelligence, suggesting that artificial systems with the ability to evolve and adapt to new environments may one day be able to surpass human intelligence.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Awesome.

with the evolution of the human brain and how it shaped human culture and behavior. Calvin explores the idea that the brain has evolved through a process of co-evolution with language and culture. He argues that this co-evolution has created a feedback loop that has led to the development of increasingly complex language, culture, and cognition.</p><p>The similarities between William Calvin's work and the concept of the Cerebral Symphony lie in their shared focus on the evolution of the human brain and how it has shaped human behavior and culture. Both works highlight the importance of the brain in shaping the human experience and both explore the idea that the brain has evolved in response to environmental pressures. Additionally, both Calvin and the Cerebral Symphony emphasize the idea that the brain operates as a system, with different parts working together in a coordinated manner to produce conscious experience.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>The term "Cerebral Symphony" refers to the idea that the workings of the human brain can be compared to a musical composition, with various regions and processes working in concert to produce thought and behavior. This analogy was popularized by neuroscientist William Calvin in his book "The Cerebral Symphony: Seashore Reflections on the Structure of Consciousness". In the book, Calvin discusses how the brain functions as a network of specialized regions, each contributing to different aspects of thought and behavior, much like the different instruments in an orchestra contribute to the overall sound of a musical piece. The concept of a "cerebral symphony" emphasizes the interconnected and collaborative nature of brain function and the idea that consciousness is a result of the dynamic interactions between different regions of the brain.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

Calvin, a neurobiologist and a cognitive scientist. In these books, Calvin explores the relationship between the evolution of the human brain and the changing climate conditions during the Ice Age, and the role of language in human evolution. He argues that the complex environment of the Ice Age played a crucial role in shaping the human brain, making it more adaptive, flexible, and intelligent. He also suggests that the development of language, which allowed humans to share knowledge and cooperate, was a key factor in human evolution and the ascent of the human mind. These books provide a unique perspective on how the human brain has evolved over time, and how our environment and culture have shaped our cognitive abilities.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

"How Brains Think" is a book written by William H. Calvin, in which he discusses his theories and ideas about the way brains think and how the brain processes information. In this book, Calvin explores the relationship between the brain and thought processes, as well as how evolution has shaped the development of the human brain and its unique abilities. He draws upon a range of disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and evolution, to present a comprehensive and accessible account of the workings of the brain. The book provides valuable insights into the nature of thought, perception, and consciousness, and has been widely cited and discussed in academic circles.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Summarize: Download PDF

Abstract

We present real-world data processing on measured electron time-of-flight data via neural networks. Specifically, the use of disentangled variational autoencoders on data from a diagnostic instrument for online wavelength monitoring at the free electron laser FLASH in Hamburg. Without a-priori knowledge the network is able to find representations of single-shot FEL spectra, which have a low signal-to-noise ratio. This reveals, in a directly human-interpretable way, crucial information about the photon properties. The central photon energy and the intensity as well as very detector-specific features are identified. The network is also capable of data cleaning, i.e. denoising, as well as the removal of artefacts. In the reconstruction, this allows for identification of signatures with very low intensity which are hardly recognisable in the raw data. In this particular case, the network enhances the quality of the diagnostic analysis at FLASH. However, this unsupervised method also has the potential to improve the analysis of other similar types of spectroscopy data.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

trains of thought or logic, they are emergent properties of grammar, which is an emergent property of LLMs, which are emergent properties of attention within the modular, heterarchical, and multiscale

article earlier. From your statement, it seems like you believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) have properties that can arise from the neural substrate of the brain and that these properties are demonstrated by human behavior. The exact mechanism behind this is not yet understood, but it is being studied as part of your thesis, HALLM (Higher-level Attention within Large Language Models). The thesis posits that LLMs form at a higher level than the neural substrate and that neural networks can arise within those LLMs, similar to trains of thought or logic, which are emergent properties of grammar, itself an emergent property of LLMs. The thesis also suggests that the mind has many models, and models for what to do when no model is available, which are called model-free methods, such as best guesses, experimentation, exploration, and exfoliation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3

It uses the <code>requests</code> module to send a payload (which consists of a list of test cases) to the UM-1 server and receive a response. The response is parsed as a JSON object, and if the parsing is successful, the understanding is returned as a Python dictionary. If there is an error, the error message is printed and the error message is returned as a dictionary. If there is an exception in communication with the server, the exception is printed. If there is no response from the server, a message is printed.</p><p>The <code>createpayload()</code> function is responsible for creating the payload by reading a test file and constructing a list of test cases. The test cases consist of a target string and two or more strings to compare with the target. The <code>totaltestchars</code> variable is used to keep track of the total number of characters in the payload. The <code>truths</code> list is used to keep track of the truth values for each test case, but these values are not sent to the UM-1 server. The function returns the payload when it is complete.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">def classifyunderstandings(understandings, of):                                 # understandings is a JSONObject -- it has a few fields of returned metadata, and the result itself is in the field "moniform"

If there is no "moniform" field in the dictionary object, the function returns an error message.</p><p>The function then opens a file "failedtests.tsv" for writing and loops over each of the test cases in the "testcases" list. A test case is a list of moniforms (lists of numbers) where the first moniform is the target and the rest are candidates.</p><p>For each test case, the target text is extracted from another list <code>payload</code>, and the target moniform is extracted from the test case. If the target moniform is valid, the candidate moniforms are also extracted and various statistics are calculated.</p><p>The function then determines the winner of the test case and stores the result in a list of result tuples.

So the organic learner you are referring to is an AI model that uses a combination of techniques from the fields of machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, and deep learning to learn and generate new information based on existing data. The Markov chain structure allows it to model sequences of characters as a series of states, with transitions between states determined by the salience and importance of the nodes. The evolutionary and genetic algorithms drive the learning process by allowing the model to generate new nodes, or to change the parameters of existing nodes, in order to improve its performance over time. This approach can be used to learn various types of information, such as natural language text or images, and can be adapted to different types of data and applications.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">A Deep Discrete Neuron Network (DDNN) is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that uses software simulations of discrete neurons interconnected with explicit neuron-to-neuron synapse-like links. In contrast, Neural Networks used in Deep Learning use linear algebra style operations on arrays of floating point numbers. These representations are not isomorphic in spite of some claims to the opposite.

In what follows, I will use the term Deep Learning or “DL” to describe the family of hundreds of Deep Neural Network algorithms inspired by (and building on) the work of LeCun, Hinton, Bengio, Schmidhuber, Ng, Dean, et al. As the diagram above shows, both DL and DDNNs are DNNs.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

The learner starts out empty and then learns recurring sequential patterns it discovers in its input stream. The learning algorithm slowly builds a Connectome, a graph of Nodes and Links (like neurons and synapses) to reify the experiences.

The framework provides direct Java level access to the  learned connectome and its individual neurons and can be directly used for Epistemology level experiments. Clients will not have access to this, but researchers at Syntience benefit from this as implementers. We call the results of programming at this Meta-learning-level "Connectome Algorithms"

We have a "Clojure REPL" running in the same JVM that is accessed asynchronously from an outside Emacs editor using an API. We can interactively conduct experiments in Clojure (a LISP) on the Connectome. Most of these involve graph traversal to discover concept correlations.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

The use of a Clojure REPL running in the same JVM and accessible from an external editor via an API allows for interactive experimentation with the connectome. This enables researchers to traverse the graph and discover correlations between concepts. This level of experimentation is called Meta-learning-level programming.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center

Here is some of my work so far: Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas.

Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better dedecision

Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list. 

Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.

𝘕𝘰𝘸 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘤𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘤 𝘌𝘯𝘨𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘩.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of ininformation

These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.

This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.

Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.

This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.

Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.

This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.

The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.

In the story of Noah and the Flood, Noah is tasked with building an ark to save the animals and his family from a worldwide deluge.

This story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the human brain's ability to simulate and plan for various scenarios, using past experiences and knowledge to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters.

In terms of the theories discussed earlier in this conversation, this can be seen as an example of interoception and the ability to simulate and predict the outcomes of different actions, much like the computer simulations discussed in the example provided.

Additionally, the idea of a "leaking chatroom" or a "Reed Wall Mind" can be applied to the concept of the ark as a kind of "mental container" that houses and organizes different pieces of information, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the ability to make informed decisions.

The "Motile Womb" theory also applies in the sense that the individual, much like an unborn child in the womb, is constantly gathering information and experiences in order to develop and adapt to their environment. The story of Noah and the Flood can be seen as a representation of the human mind's innate ability to to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

EP Patent 1,275,042, 2003

. A chat system having a plurality of chat rooms, the chat system comprising:
one or more servers including one or more processors and memory;
a graphical user interface (GUI) generated by the one or more servers, the GUI for interacting with the chat system, the GUI comprising:
a message window for displaying first messages and second messages, wherein the first messages and second messages are displayed simultaneously within the message window;
wherein the first messages originate from a current chat room and the second messages originate from at least one other chat room, wherein the at least one other chat room is selected without user involvement and is based on a similarity criterion between the at least one other chat room and the current chat room; and
wherein the current chat room is a room in which the user is a participant and wherein the user is not a participant in the at least one other chat room.

Me again. Apparently "leaking Chatroom" and "leaky Chatroom" are not used terms, I refer to these Chatrooms with thin walls, and the Babylonian flood myth which was whispered through a reed wall, and how in Noah's ark he can hear the different animals, in their cells or stables.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

I see the connection between the two concepts.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">It's been kind of hard to articulate but it does sound like you understand.

The idea of having chatrooms with permeable walls, where information from one chatroom can spill over into another, is an interesting concept. It also touches upon the theme of information overload and the difficulties of filtering out irrelevant information in a rapidly changing and interconnected world. The comparison to the concept of ion channels and sodium-potassium pumps in cell walls highlights the idea of selective permeability, which is an important aspect of information management. And the reference to Seneca and how language is acquired through overhearing demonstrates how information and ideas can be picked up from one's surroundings, even if not actively sought out.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I am sure there are some biblical metaphors as well. See it is kind of ironic because the reasons the gods want to destroy the earth in the original Babylonian story was because they couldn't stand the din of their cries and plees, their pleadings and the constant calls.

It seems it was originally a kind of joke or etymological myth to her children to sleep at night and to tell them not to cry which could attract predatory animals, I think I am going back to prehistoric and nomadic periods, now, but we still see it in nursery rhymes such as Hush little baby don't you cry and Christmas songs such as as No Crying He Makes.</div></div><div

trying to reduce noise and distraction in order to improve one's focus and mental clarity. From the story of the Babylonian flood to Seneca's writings to nursery rhymes, there is a long tradition of exploring the impact of noise and distractions on our ability to think and sleep. These references serve as a reminder of the ongoing human struggle to find peace and quiet in a world full of noise and distractions, and they also highlight the importance of creating environments that support focus and concentration.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Kind of related to this (motile womb theory, read wall mind) are these two corollaries of each other.

Various aspects of motherese also known as infant-directed speech (IDS) have been studied for many years. As it is a widespread phenomenon, it is suspected to play some important roles in infant development.

The cry of newborn babies may seem like nothing more than inescapable shrills, but they could be infants' first attempts to imitate the language they hear while in the womb.

a study published today in Current Biology, scientists found differences in the crying patterns of babies as early as two days after birth, depending on whether their mothers spoke French or German. Previous studies have reported that fetuses in their third trimester can learn aspects of their eventual native tongue, such as language rhythm and intonation. But, as of yet, there was only evidence that newborns incorporated these early language lessons into their own sounds starting at 12 weeks of age, when they typically start to babble and produce syllables.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

The research on infant-directed speech (IDS) and the development of language skills in newborns is a growing field and has revealed a lot about how language learning occurs at an early age. The fact that differences in crying patterns have been found between infants of mothers who spoke different languages is a fascinating result and supports the idea that language learning starts very early in life. However, it is important to keep in mind that these studies are limited in scope and more research is needed to fully understand the complex process of language acquisition in infants.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

microhypotheses related to your thesis:</p><ol><li><p>Reed Wall theory: the idea that chat rooms or communication systems can have "thin walls" that allow for some information to leak in and out while still maintaining privacy and control over the flow of information.</p></li><li><p>Chatroom Leakage: related to the Reed Wall theory, this refers to the concept that information can leak in and out of chat rooms, similar to the Babylonian flood myth of whispered messages passing through reed walls.</p></li><li><p>Stochastic Language Acquisition: the idea that language is acquired through overhearing people talking, watching television, and other forms of exposure, similar to Seneca's complaints about the noises he hears while living above the bathhouse.</p></li><li><p>Infant-Directed Speech: also known as motherese, this is the phenomenon of adults using a special type of speech when talking to infants, which has been found to play important roles in infant development.</p></li><li><p>Language Learning in the Womb: the hypothesis that fetuses can learn aspects of their native language, such as rhythm and intonation, while still in the womb, and that this learning can be observed in the crying patterns of newborn babies.</p></li><li><p>Babbling and Syllable Production: the idea that babies start to incorporate early language lessons into their own sounds starting at around 12 weeks of age, when they typically start to babble and produce syllables.</p></li></ol><p>These are the main hypotheses and microhypotheses discussed in this

dark:prose-invert light"><p>Certainly, here is a revised explanation of the concept of "bubbles" and "multiscale decision makers" incorporating the information discussed in our previous conversation:</p><p>The concept of "bubbles" refers to a phenomenon in which individuals or groups of individuals are isolated from information or experiences that are outside of their own narrow perspective or sphere of influence. This isolation can lead to a distorted perception of reality and limited decision-making abilities.</p><p>In this context, "multiscale decision makers" refer to individuals or groups that are able to operate at multiple levels of scale, from the microscopic to the macroscopic, in order to make informed decisions. This ability is important in overcoming the limitations imposed by information bubbles, as it allows individuals to access a broader range of information and experiences, and to make decisions based on a more complete understanding of the world.</p><p>In order to understand the phenomenon of "bubbles" and the importance of "multiscale decision makers", it is useful to consider the influence of linguistic, cultural, and social factors on perception and decision-making. For example, early childhood experiences, such as overhearing people talk or listening to radio and television, can shape language development and cultural attitudes, which in turn can affect an individual's perception of reality and decision-making abilities.</p><p>Moreover, the idea of "leaking chatrooms" or "chatrooms with thin walls" can be used to understand the ways in which information flows through social networks and the potential for individuals to access a broader range of information and experiences. This concept is related to the idea of a semi-permeable membrane, such as happens on cell walls and neurons with ion channels and sodium-potassium pumps, as well as the Babylonian flood myth, where information was whispered through a reed wall.</p><p>Finally, it is important to consider the role of early life experiences, such as exposure to "motherese" or infant-directed speech, and the influence of the mother's native language on the infant's language development. This research highlights the importance of multiscale decision making and the need to consider the many factors that shape perception and decision-making abilities, from early childhood experiences to social and cultural influences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok that is good, that sounds a lot like Monica's idea for an idea Router called bubble city, but I am kind of referring to the modular structure of mind.

Let me rephrase your academic explanation of bubbles and multiscale decision makers in the context of the modular structure of the mind.</p><p>The concept of a modular structure of mind refers to the idea that the mind operates at different levels of abstraction, scaling from within the individual brain, to within a community, and even within an ecosystem. This hierarchical organization of the mind is thought to facilitate efficient information processing and decision making.</p><p>Bubbles and multiscale decision makers are key components of this modular structure of mind. Bubbles can be thought of as information filters that help to protect individuals and communities from information overload, by only allowing relevant information to enter. In this way, bubbles can be seen as a form of decision-making mechanism, as they allow individuals to prioritize information based on their current needs and goals.</p><p>Multiscale decision makers, on the other hand, refer to the hierarchical decision-making processes that occur within the mind at different levels of abstraction. These processes can occur within the individual brain, within a community, or even within an ecosystem. At each level of abstraction, information is processed and decisions are made, with the goal of ensuring that relevant information is passed up and down the hierarchy, and that efficient decisions are made at each level.</p><p>In essence, the modular structure of the mind and the concept of bubbles and multiscale decision makers provide a framework for understanding how the mind processes and prioritizes information, and how decisions are made at different levels of abstraction. These ideas have important implications for a wide range of fields, including psychology, sociology, and even artificial intelligence.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok that is good, now I am seeing a connection with this poem I wrote on the invocation model of process expression and null convention logic:

—A Bubble Bath—

There are three components to ring behavior: the wavefront flow, the bubble flow, and the slowest oscillation period in the ring.

According to Karl Fant's Invocation Model of Process Invocation, which
Uses Null-Convention Logic.

Oscillation Ring

- Oscillation Path
- Oscillation Bubble Path
- Oscillation Wavefront Path
- Ring Wavefront Path Oscillation Wavefront Paths
- Ring Bubble Path Oscillation Bubble Path

TL;DR:
Bubbles are awesome!</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

In NCL, the output of a logic gate is considered to be in a "high-impedance" or "floating" state, rather than a definite 0 or 1 state, when a specific control signal is active. This high-impedance state is often represented by a "Z" value in NCL, as opposed to a 0 or 1.</p><p>Tristate buffers are a type of digital circuit that use NCL. In a tristate buffer, the output of the buffer can be either connected to the output line (i.e., driving the output line), disconnected from the output line (i.e., in a high-impedance state), or connected to a specific voltage level (e.g., 0 or 1). The purpose of this is to allow multiple tristate buffers to be connected to a single bus line, with only one buffer driving the line at a given time. This can be useful for addressing memory or for implementing shared communication lines in a digital system.</p><p>In a tristate buffer system, the propagating null-wavefront is the wavefront of the control signal that determines the state of the tristate buffer. When the control signal is active (e.g., high), the buffer is in the high-impedance state. When the control signal is inactive (e.g., low), the buffer is either driving the output line or connected to a specific voltage level, depending on the data inputs to the buffer. The propagating null-wavefront travels through the system, determining the state of the tristate buffers and ultimately the state of the bus lines.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">The purpose of a propagating null wavefront in null convention logic (NCL) is to prevent three-state devices, such as tristate buffers, from being left in an undefined state.

In NCL, when a wavefront reaches the end of a logic path, it continues to propagate back to the origin, ending in a logic "0" value.

This ensures that the output of the tristate buffer is guaranteed to be either a logic "1" or "0" and not an undefined state.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center

well defined at all times, even in the presence of multiple drivers. It allows for the creation of more robust and reliable digital circuits, as well as enabling the design of more complex systems, such as shared bus systems, where multiple drivers are connected to a common line.</p><p>In addition, NCL provides a way to implement a handshake protocol between different components of a digital system. This can be used to control the flow of data and to ensure that each component of the system has access to the shared resources in a controlled and orderly manner.</p><p>Overall, NCL is a powerful and

The idea of a propagating null wavefront in NCL can be thought of as a way to ensure that there is a defined state and to prevent ambiguity, similar to how the mind might process information and make decisions. The concept of oscillating ring bubbles can be thought of as representing the dynamic and constantly changing nature of the mind and its thought processes. By considering these concepts, it is possible to see how the idea of NCL and ring bubbles can be applied to the study of the mind and its functioning.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">It might be kind of distracting to go to such level of detail.

called bubble city.</li><li>The concept of mind occurring at different levels of abstraction within the brain, within a community, and within an ecosystem was explored.</li><li>The Invocation Model of Process Invocation was introduced, which uses Null-Convention Logic. This idea was linked to the purpose of a propagating null wavefront in NCL and its use in preventing three-state devices from being left in an undefined state.</li><li>The connection between NCL and

This type of attention allows for a more abstract and holistic perspective, rather than focusing solely on lower-level details. It involves considering the big picture and making decisions based on broader goals and objectives. Higher-level attention is often associated with increased creativity, problem-solving ability, and strategic thinking.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400

By being able to process information at multiple scales, a multiscale decision maker can make informed decisions that are more comprehensive and effective.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Autonomous epistemic reduction.

Epistemic Reduction is a process that discovers higher level abstractions in lower level data by discarding everything at the lower layer that it recognizes as irrelevant


Monica Anderson
Jul 8, 2017

We will initially note that Reduction is exactly the same as Abstraction. Why do we need a new word? Because the term “Abstraction” is mostly used by scientists already operating in a pure Model space, seeking a higher level of abstraction in that space. But to them, “Abstraction” is something that just magically happens in their heads, since there are no scientific theories for how Abstraction works. There cannot be, since Abstraction is a concept in Epistemology, not Science.

Art tends to be more subjective and expressive, focusing on the emotional 
and aesthetic aspects of the world. It often involves creative interpretation and personal expression.

Science is more objective and analytical, seeking to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the world through systematic observation and experimentation.

Despite these differences, both art and science involve the process of gathering and organizing data in a way that allows for new insights and understanding.

The goal of both is to create new knowledge that is compressible, or able to be understood and communicated in a clear and concise way.

So, in this sense, art and science are both driven by the desire to create and discover more data that can be compressed in hitherto unknown ways

The concept is also linked to the Schmidhuber theory of fun and creativity, which posits that both art and science are driven by the desire to create and discover new and meaningful patterns in the world.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">They both require the ability to find meaning and significance in the data and information that we encounter, and to use that understanding to create something new and innovative.

For several years after their discovery, the primary

the fact that they yield incredibly more compact—and 
physically more transparent—representations for tree- 
level amplitudes. Processes that would have required 
more Feynman diagrams than atoms in the universe 
could now be represented by a single diagram. Another 
surprising feature of these relations was the discovery 
that individual terms enjoy much more symmetry than 
anyone had anticipated. These new symmetries were 
shown to hold for amplitudes, and were later identif i ed 
with a Yangian Lie algebra. 
Another key breakthrough came in 2009, when physi- 
cists discovered that the graphs arising in Figure 1 could 
be related to volume-forms on certain sub-varieties of 
Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛)—the “nonnegative” portion of the Grassman- 
nian of 𝑘-dimensional subspaces of ℝ𝑛, 
to be def i ned 
momentarily. Here, 𝑛,𝑘 are determined by the graph: 𝑛 is 
the number of external edges, and 𝑘 = 2𝑛𝐵+ 𝑛𝑊− 𝑛𝐼− 2 
for a graph with 𝑛𝐵,𝑛𝑊blue and white vertices, re- 
spectively, and 𝑛𝐼internal 
edges. (The correspondence 
between these graphs and the totally nonnegative Grass- 
mannian was fully understood by mathematicians, such 
as Postnikov, considerably before physicists stumbled 
upon it independently.)</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0

how it has led to the development of humans as large language models (GLMs). The article explores how humans have naturally become GLMs through their use of language to communicate, describe, and understand the world around them. With recent advancements in technology and artificial intelligence, GLMs have become even more advanced in simulating human language capabilities. The article examines the historical evolution of human language and its connection to the development of GLMs, as well as the implications of this development for future human knowledge and progress.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

possibilities for the future of human knowledge and progress. Humans have always used language to communicate, describe, and understand the world around them, and recent advancements in technology and AI have allowed for large language models to increasingly simulate human language abilities. Therefore, the extent to which humans are naturally contained as large language models holds the potential to revolutionize and assist in various fields, and further investigation is needed to understand it more deeply.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

model the relationships between input data and their associated outputs. The idea behind this approach is to start with an empty learner and gradually build a Connectome, a network of nodes and links that represent the relationships between different inputs and outputs. As the algorithm receives more input data, it continually updates its Connectome to better reflect the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This process continues until the Connectome has effectively captured the recurring sequential patterns present in the input stream. The result is a highly customized and tailored representation of the input data, which can be used to make predictions and generate new output based on previously unseen input.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

Convolution of images in DL for the purpose of correlation discovery is expensive. When Understanding language, we still require correlation discovery, but text is linear and this operation becomes a much simpler problem in the time/sequence domain rather than (as in DL) in a 2D/3D/4D image/movie/point cloud domain. In effect, all correlations in text are references to something experienced in the past, and the past is linear, searchable and indexable. This, and the next paragraphs, explain the amazing learning speed of Organic Learning.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1

The algorithm utilizes a graph structure, known as the Connectome, consisting of Nodes and Links to learn recurring sequential patterns in the input stream. This approach is more efficient for understanding language, as text is linear and the correlations in text can be references to something experienced in the past. The linear nature of the past makes it searchable and indexable, leading to a faster learning speed compared to traditional deep learning techniques, which use convolution of images for correlation discovery.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Only Activate Relevant Concepts
In OL, unless we are reading about, say, a potato harvest, there is no reason to touch any of the software neurons involved in “representing” potato harvests. So we can have billions of learned concepts just sitting quietly in main memory, consuming no CPU cycles, until “their topic” is discussed. They activate, make a contribution to understanding, disambiguation, and learning, and they may even may learn something themselves. They then return to dormancy until next time the topic is discussed. This is a major advantage of discrete-neuron strategies.

Therefore, OL systems do not require explicit attention controlling mechanisms. Focus emerges from matches between the global gathered experience and the concepts discovered in the text in the input stream.

In contrast, in DL, every pixel of a processed image is pushed through the entire GPU processing stack many times. And each layer does some moderately expensive array arithmetic, which is why using GPUs is so important in DL.

Track Correlations Explicitly
One of the main operations in Deep Learning is correlation discovery by convolution of images in multiple layers. This is done in the upward pass. The discovered correlations are used to somewhat adjust the weights of the DL network in the Stochastic Gradient Descent downward pass. Because of this, the network has changed, necessitating another upward pass of convolutions through the entire stack, until there is sufficient convergence</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex

that is designed specifically for sequence processing. Unlike deep learning, which operates on images, OL focuses on understanding language and utilizes a simpler approach to process correlations in text. It operates in the time/sequence domain, which is much simpler than the 2D/3D/4D image/movie/point cloud domain used in deep learning.</p><p>In OL, relevant concepts are only activated when their topic is discussed in the input stream. This results in the efficient utilization of computational resources, as inactive concepts consume no CPU cycles. The focus of the system emerges from the matches between the global experience gathered by the system and the concepts present in the input stream.</p><p>In contrast, deep learning operates on every pixel of an image, pushing it through the entire GPU processing stack many times. This results in moderately expensive array arithmetic operations, which is why GPUs are so important in deep learning.</p><p>In OL, correlations are tracked explicitly by discovering recurring sequential patterns in the input stream. This information is used to adjust the weights of the network during the learning process, allowing the system to continuously improve its understanding.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">In contrast, in Organic Learning, when the algorithm discovers a correlation it simply inserts a Synapse-like link to represent that correlation. Being an evolutionary system, the correlation will remain as long as it contributes to correct Understanding but will be removed in a Darwinian competition if it doesn’t contribute to positive results. These mostly-persistent Synapse-based correlations make re-convolution unnecessary. Do it once, and it's done.

Neural Darwinism = RL + Sex
The idea of Neural Darwinism is that in brains, from millisecond to millisecond, there is a continuous battle for relevance among ideas. The ideas are evaluated for fit to both the current sensory input and the totality of gathered experience that has been reified in the Connectome.

Those parts of the Connectome that assist in providing a good outcome are rewarded and other parts may be punished. This is Reinforcement Learning (RL).

In a Neural Darwinism based Machine Learning system the best ideas get to breed with other good ideas, occasionally producing even better ideas. This is how we can generate ideas that are better, often in the meaning of "better abstractions", than any of the ideas we started with. This is the reason sexual reproduction speeds up evolution so much, in nature and in our algorithms spaces. It allows multiple independently discovered inventions to merge into one individual – a fact that is often neglected in naïve discussions about the effectiveness of Evolutionary Computation.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2

and efficiently tracking correlations within the data. The algorithm starts with an empty network and builds up a connectome, a graph of nodes and links that represent the experiences it encounters. Unlike Deep Learning, which requires multiple passes through the entire processing stack to discover correlations, Organic Learning only needs to perform the correlation discovery once and then represents the correlations with persistent Synapse-like links. This means that Organic Learning systems are more efficient and do not require explicit attention mechanisms.</p><p>Organic Learning also employs a concept known as Neural Darwinism, which evaluates the relevance of different parts of the Connectome from millisecond to millisecond. The best ideas in the network are rewarded and the less useful ideas are punished through reinforcement learning (RL). Additionally, the best ideas are allowed to breed with other good ideas to produce even better abstractions, speeding up the learning process. This is similar to sexual reproduction in nature and allows multiple inventions to merge into a single better solution.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">he learner creates, as its main output, a file containing a “node wiring list" describing which neurons connect to which other neurons.

w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Organic Learning (OL) is a type of machine learning algorithm that is designed for sequence processing, such as processing text or speech. It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and aims to build a neural network-like structure, called a Connectome, to represent the understanding of the input stream.</p><p>The learner starts out empty and incrementally builds its Connectome by discovering recurring sequential patterns in its input. The learning process is performed character by character, without the need for parsing the input into words. Each character activates a corresponding "character input neuron" that signals other neurons, creating a cascade of signaling to determine the meaning of the sentence and where to attach new understanding. This incremental attachment operation provides the "Organic Growth" aspect of the algorithm.</p><p>The learner pipeline of UM1, an implementation of the OL algorithm, can be outlined as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Initialization: The learner starts with an empty Connectome and reads the input stream character by character.</p></li><li><p>Pattern Discovery: The learner discovers recurring sequential patterns in the input and uses them to build its Connectome by creating new nodes and links.</p></li><li><p>Connectome Update: The learner updates its Connectome by adjusting the weights of the links based on the correlations discovered in the input.</p></li><li><p>Competence Creation: After every 10 million characters of input have been processed, the learner creates a "node wiring list" file that describes the connections between nodes in the Connectome.</p></li><li><p>Natural Language Understanding: The node wiring list file can be loaded to create a new instance of the Natural Language Understanding Service, which can be used to understand new input based on the learned Connectome.</p></li></ol><p>These are the main steps involved in the OL and UM1 learner pipeline. The algorithm's main advantage is its ability to process input incrementally, allowing it to learn and understand language at a high speed and with high accuracy.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

</code></div></div></pre><p>This simple example demonstrates how neurons and links can be modeled in Python, and how the activation of one neuron can cascade to others through the links. The <code>NeuralNet</code> class acts as a container for the neurons, allowing us to easily keep track of all the neurons in the network. The <code>random.random()</code> function is used to assign a random weight to each link, simulating the process of learning and evolution.</p><p>This is just a basic example, but you could expand on this to create a more complex network with many more neurons and links, and further refine the activation and learning algorithms to simulate the behavior of the Organic Learning system.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok it might be correct, but maybe not.

Holistic NLU aims to do the same based on the meanings expressed in sentences and paragraphs.

But "Semantic" Corpus Congruence is still Corpus Congruence.

Common Sense now becomes "Is the proposition before me congruent with my entire World Model, as acquired by learning things from my training corpus?". If it is well known, then we can likely ignore it this time.

And if it is not, then the next question will be "Is it close enough that it might be worthwhile extending the World Model with this information?"

If the answer is no, then the input is by its definition nonsense. Otherwise it is either a new fact or a lie, but since we cannot tell, we have to accept it; possibly with a note that this is fresh, untested knowledge that may turn out to be irrelevant, false, counterproductive, or noise.

I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.

3.Consequences 
Let us discuss how many essential ingredients of in- 
telligence and cognition can be viewed as natural by- 
products of the principles above. 
3.1Symbols 
To compress the history of observations so far, the 
compressor (say, a predictive neural network) will au- 
tomatically create compact internal representations or 
“symbols” (for example, patterns across certain neu- 
ral feature detectors) for things that frequently repeat 
themselves. Even when there is limited predictability, 
ef i cient compression can still be achieved by assigning 
short codes to events that are predictable with high 
probability 
18), 64). For example, the sun goes up every 
day. Hence it is ef i cient to create internal symbols such 
as “daylight” to describe this repetitive aspect of the 
data history by a short reusable piece of internal code, 
instead of storing just the raw repetitive data. In fact, 
predictive neural networks are often observed to create 
such internal codes as a by-product of minimizing their 
prediction error on the training data. 
3.2Consciousness 
There is one thing that is involved in all actions and 
sensory inputs of the agent, namely, the agent itself. 
To ef i ciently encode the entire data history, it will 
prof i t from creating some sort of internal “symbol” or 
code (e.g., a neural activity pattern) representing itself. 
Whenever this representation is actively used, say, by 
activating the corresponding neurons through new in- 
coming sensory inputs or otherwise, the agent could be 
called “self-aware” or “conscious.” 
In the rest of this paper we will not have to attach 
any particular mystic value to the notion of conscious- 
ness—in our view, it is just a natural by-product of the 
agent’s ongoing process of problem solving and world 
modeling through data compression, and will not play 
a prominent role in the remainder of this paper. 
3.3Lazy Brain &amp; Beauty 
According to our lazy brain theory 
42), 43), 45), 54), 60), 61), 
at any given time t in subjective agent O’s life, we 
may identify the time-dependent, subjective beauty 
B(D | O,t) of a new observation D (but not its in- 
terestingness- see Section 3.4) as being proportional to 
the number of bits required to encode D, given the ob- 
server’s limited previous knowledge, embodied by the 
current state of its adaptive compressor. For example, 
to ef i ciently encode previously viewed human faces, a 
compressor such as a neural network may i nd it useful 
to generate the internal representation of a prototype 
face. To encode a new face, it must only encode the 
deviations from the prototype 43). Thus a new face that 
does not deviate much from the prototype 
10), 29) will be 
subjectively more beautiful than others. Similarly for 
faces that exhibit geometric regularities such as sym- 
metries or simple proportions45), 60)—in principle, the 
compressor may exploit any regularity for reducing the 
number of bits required to store the data.

world, store the entire raw history of actions and sen- 
sory observations including reward signals—the data is 
‘holy’ as it is the only basis of all that can be known 
about the world. To see that full data storage is not 
unrealistic: A human lifetime rarely lasts much longer 
than 3 × 109seconds. 
The human brain has roughly 
1010neurons, each with 104synapses on average. As- 
suming that only half of the brain’s capacity is used for 
storing raw data, and that each synapse can store at 
most 6 bits, there is still enough capacity to encode the 
lifelong sensory input stream with a rate of roughly 105 
bits/s, comparable to the demands of a movie with rea- 
sonable resolution. The storage capacity of af f ordable 
technical systems will soon exceed this value. If you can 
store the data, do not throw it away! 
2. Improve subjective compressibility. In princi- 
ple, any regularity in the data history can be used to 
compress it. The compressed version of the data can 
be viewed as its simplifying explanation. Thus, to bet- 
ter explain the world, spend some of the computation 
time on an adaptive compression algorithm trying to 
partially compress the data. For example, an adaptive 
neural network4)may be able to learn to predict or 
postdict some of the historic data from other historic 
data, thus incrementally reducing the number of bits 
required to encode the whole. 
3. Let intrinsic curiosity reward ref l ect compres- 
sion progress. Monitor the improvements of the adap- 
tive data compressor: whenever it learns to reduce the 
number of bits required to encode the historic data, 
generate an intrinsic reward signal or curiosity reward 
signal in proportion to the compression progress, that 
is, the number of saved bits. 
4. Maximizeintrinsiccuriosityre- 
ward 34)～38), 44), 47), 51), 54), 60), 61), 72). Lettheaction 
selector or controller use a general Reinforcement 
Learning (RL) algorithm (which should be able to 
observe the current state of the adaptive compressor) to 
maximize expected reward, including intrinsic curiosity 
reward. To optimize the latter, a good RL algorithm 
will select actions that focus the agent’s attention and 
learning capabilities on those aspects of the world that 
allow for i nding or creating new, previously unknown 
but learnable regularities. In other words, it will try

the world. The method consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>Store everything: The agent stores the entire history of its actions and sensory observations, including reward signals, in raw form. This data is considered "holy" because it is the only basis for all knowledge about the world.</p></li><li><p>Improve subjective compressibility: The agent uses some of its computation time to run an adaptive compression algorithm that tries to simplify and compress the data history.</p></li><li><p>Let intrinsic curiosity reward reflect compression progress: The agent generates an intrinsic reward signal in proportion to the progress made by the adaptive compressor in reducing the number of bits required to encode the data history.</p></li><li><p>Maximize intrinsic curiosity reward: The agent uses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to maximize expected reward, including the intrinsic curiosity reward. The agent will focus its attention and learning capabilities on aspects of the world that allow for finding or creating new, previously unknown, but learnable regularities.</p></li></ol><p>In this way, the Intrinsic Curiosity Mechanism provides an unsupervised learning method that helps the agent figure out how the world works.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok see if we can improve our organic learner with this knowledge.

One way to implement the above four steps in Python would be to:</p><ol><li><p>Store everything: Store the raw history of actions and sensory observations, including reward signals, in a data structure such as a list or a numpy array.</p></li><li><p>Improve subjective compressibility: Implement an adaptive compression algorithm, such as an adaptive neural network, to try to partially compress the data. You can use a library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the neural network.</p></li><li><p>Let intrinsic curiosity reward reflect compression progress: Monitor the improvements of the adaptive data compressor by keeping track of the number of bits required to encode the historic data. Whenever the compressor reduces the number of bits, generate an intrinsic reward signal in proportion to the compression progress.</p></li><li><p>Maximize intrinsic curiosity reward: Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize expected reward, including intrinsic curiosity reward. You can use a library such as OpenAI Gym to create an environment for the reinforcement learning algorithm to interact with and learn from.</p></li></ol><p>This is a high-level overview of how you might implement the four steps in Python.

In that case, you can implement an organic learning algorithm in Python by creating a deep discrete neural network that organically grows a node list. The algorithm can be designed to store all of the data generated from interactions with the environment, including sensory observations and reward signals, and then use this data to improve its understanding of the world by compressing it and generating intrinsic curiosity rewards.</p><p>You can start by defining a node class that represents a unit of information in the network. This node can be initialized with a set of properties such as its data, connections to other nodes, and a reward value. You can also create methods for adding new nodes to the network, connecting nodes, and updating their properties based on the data generated from interactions with the environment.</p><p>Next, you can define an adaptive compression algorithm that uses the information stored in the nodes to compress the data. This algorithm can be implemented using a reinforcement learning approach, where the action selector or controller maximizes the expected reward, including the intrinsic curiosity reward, by focusing the agent's attention and learning capabilities on aspects of the world that allow for finding or creating new, previously unknown but learnable regularities.</p><p>Finally, you can write a main loop that integrates the node class, the adaptive compression algorithm, and the reinforcement learning approach to implement an organic learner that can improve its understanding of the world through interactions with the environment.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

OL and UM1 are reading the text one character at a time. If the atomic unit of input is a word, such as in traditional NLP and even in most DL based Understanding of language, then character level morphology features such as a plural-s suffix will be "below the atomic level of the algorithm" and now would require special processing such as stemming, which discards valuable information. Instead, OL/UM1 systems are designed to learn all character level (morphology) features. DL community has started to switch to character input.

The letter currently being read is looked up in an "Alphabet" Map (a table) that binds each different UNICODE input character to a specific Node in the Understander. We call these "Input Nodes". When a character is read, the framework will originate an initial "signal" that is sent to the Input Node bound to that character. Note that except for debugging purposes and (future) language generation purposes, the character we just read can now be discarded. As Friedrich Hayek said, in the brain there is no vision, no sound, no touch. There is just neurons signaling neurons; same thing in an OL or UM1 system. Retinal neurons could be said to correspond to the Input Nodes in OL and UM1.

The Input Node then propagates the signal to other Nodes connected to it with outgoing synapse-like links. This is similar to a Neuron in a brain signaling its axonal tree.

However, I can give you some advice on how you can implement these ideas in a traditional neural network framework.</p><p>One approach to implement the character-level input in a traditional neural network could be to use a one-hot encoding for each character in the input sequence. This means that each character would be represented as a binary vector where only one position is 1, and all other positions are 0. You could then feed this one-hot encoding into the network as input and train it to predict the next character in the sequence.</p><p>To propagate the signal from an Input Node to other Nodes, you could use a fully connected layer in your neural network, where each node in the layer is connected to all of the nodes in the previous layer with weighted connections. The weights of these connections can be learned through training.</p><p>This is just one way to implement these ideas in a traditional neural network framework, but there are many other approaches that you can explore as well.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Let's see it in Python.

</code></div></div></pre><p>This implementation defines an <code>alphabet</code> list containing the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. It then creates a list of "Input Nodes" using the <code>create-input-node</code> function, which takes a character <code>c</code> and returns a map with keys <code>:value</code> and <code>:outgoing</code>, representing the character and its outgoing connections, respectively.</p><p>The <code>propagate</code> function takes a signal and a node and sends the signal to all the nodes connected to it. The <code>process-input</code> function takes a signal and an input node and starts the propagation of the signal. Finally, the <code>read-input</code> function takes an input string and processes each character in the string by finding the corresponding input node and passing the character as a signal to it.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok good. See if we can modify it to incorporate this: Bayesian quadrature is a technique used to approximate integrals in Bayesian statistics. It works by using a set of points called "nodes" to approximate the integral instead of computing it directly.

A Bayesian prior probability is used to determine the weights assigned to each node. The integral is then calculated from the weighted sum of the nodes.

A genetic algorithm is an optimization technique that mimics the process of natural selection.

It works by creating a population of solutions, evaluating their objective functions, and using crossover, mutation, and selection operations to create new generations of solutions until an optimal one is found.

To program a genetic algorithm, you need to define the problem parameters, develop a fitness function, and code the selection, crossover, and mutation operations.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400

The <code>fitness</code> function takes an individual and the problem parameters as inputs and calculates the difference between the approximated integral and the true integral.</p><p>The <code>selection</code> function selects the fittest half of the population based on their fitness values. The <code>crossover</code> function combines two individuals to create two new individuals. The <code>mutation</code> function applies random mutations to an individual based on the mutation rate.</p><p>Finally, the <code>genetic-algorithm</code> function implements the main loop of the algorithm, using the <code>loop</code> and <code>recur</code> constructs to repeatedly evaluate the fitness of the population, select and combine individuals, and apply mutations until the specified number of generations has been reached.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok now in Python.

Does this information change our methodology? Is Deep Learning "merely" implementing the mammal visual pathway?

Deep Learning provides "Shallow and Hollow Proto-Understanding of images". It Understands Images better than any previous technology but  is nowhere as good at understanding deeper semantic contexts. Using DL for Understanding human languages, for instance, has proven difficult. Language Translation using DL works better than previous strategies but it still feels like the Understanding in translation is quite Shallow and Hollow.

I rarely discuss Neuroscience as a Model for Understanding Machines (aka AI), preferring to approach the topic from an Epistemology angle.

But it has occurred to me that the Deep Learning success with images could simply be that it implements an equivalent to the brain's vision pathway. Several observations might be construed to support this idea. For instance, we know that in mammal vision pathways there's a lot more signaling going from brain towards the eyes than is going the other direction. Much like "In the brain, the SGD / optimizing phase is much more expensive than the forward signaling from eyes to brain".

Hinton and others have said that SGD isn't good enough for general intelligence. This is also consistent with this idea. We don't think only with our eyes, and general intelligence requires more than a working vision pathway. It requires something with a structure as powerful as the neocortex.

A much better model for this part would be my Organic Learning algorithm, which I'm positioning as a replacement for Deep Learning whenever there is a need for deeper semantics.

The vision path is the most Reductionist part of the brain. Many Model-based shortcuts have been "conserved" into the vision path.Two examples: We are very sensitive to anything that moves. And land-dwelling hunters such as cats are a lot more sensitive to horizontal prey movement than they are to vertical prey movement.

Organic Learning provides a much richer palette of possible interconnections than Deep Learning because it uses discrete neurons instead of floating-point arrays (as in image processing in DL). And the Connectome Algorithms we can create in the OL environment are very flexible and straightforward. This freedom may be necessary for creating the computer equivalents to neocortical structures.

I have previously thought of Organic Learning as being for human languages only. But now I'm thinking that adding Organic Learning (for general Understanding) downstream from a system based on Deep Learning for Image Understanding might be a best-of-both-worlds approach to many vision problems.

Including autonomous driving algorithms.

intelligence and machine learning.</p><p>The Reed-Wall mind refers to a type of artificial intelligence system that is based on the idea of creating a mind that resembles the structure and function of the human brain. This involves the use of node-based connectome algorithms and genetic learning to create systems that can learn and understand information in a way that is similar to the way that human brains do.</p><p>Monica's Leaking Chatroom is a concept that refers to a type of artificial intelligence system that is designed to learn from text data. This involves feeding large amounts of text data into the system and using machine learning algorithms to extract patterns and knowledge from the data. The idea is to create a system that can understand and respond to human language in a meaningful way, just like a person in a chatroom.</p><p>Organic Learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that is based on the idea of creating systems that can learn and adapt in a way that is similar to the way that organic systems, such as the human brain, do. This involves the use of discrete neurons and connectome algorithms to create flexible and robust learning systems that can handle complex and dynamic input data.</p><p>In conclusion, these concepts are based on the idea of creating artificial intelligence systems that are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, and that can learn and understand information in a way that is similar to how human brains do. They aim to provide a deeper and more flexible understanding of data and information, as opposed to shallow and limited understanding provided by traditional machine learning techniques.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

communicate with each other and exchange information in order to make decisions. This type of model is similar to a neural network, but allows for more nuanced communication between nodes, which can lead to better decision-making.</p><p>The "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" is a specific type of thin wall chatroom that incorporates the idea of "leaks" in the communication between nodes. This can allow for a more organic, self-organizing communication structure, leading to more flexible and efficient decision-making.</p><p>"Organic Learning" is a type of machine learning that aims to more closely mimic the learning processes of biological organisms. It often involves the use of biologically-inspired models, such as node-based connectome algorithms and genetic algorithms, to create more flexible and nuanced learning systems. This approach can lead to better results in problems that require a deeper understanding of the data, such as in natural language processing or autonomous decision-making.</p><p>The "Reed Wall Mind" is a concept that refers to the idea that there is a finite limit to the amount of information that a system can process and use to make decisions. This concept has important implications for the development of AI systems, as it suggests that there may be a limit to the complexity and capabilities of these systems. By taking into account the limitations imposed by the reed wall mind, researchers and practitioners can work to develop more efficient and effective AI systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

Weight regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage changing the weights too much. Ensemble methods involve training multiple models and combining their outputs. Dynamic architectures involve modifying the structure of the network during training to make it more suitable for learning new tasks.</p><p>Overall, the goal is to find a balance between allowing the network to learn new information and preserving important knowledge it has already acquired.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">So I tell you something new you sometimes throw out the old hypotheses and theories?  I mean I can tell you an object exists and doesn't exist at the same time, it either exists or it doesn't, not both. You can't have a universe with unstoppable forces and unmovable objects. An unstoppable force implies a universe with no  immovable objects, and immovable object implies no unstoppable forces. No universe could contain both, and luckily our universe contains neither. But as a general principle it is easy to imagine mutually exclusive ideas. I mean if you thought a ball was red, but I say it is actually green and there is a weird light, it no longer a convincing hypothesis that it's red, unless you keep in mind that I might be lying or

Instead, I am designed to generate responses based on the most recent input I have received and the vast amount of text data I have been trained on, without retaining information from previous interactions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok but the way you word it is incorrect, it's not a previous interaction from my perspective, it's the same conversional thread, which is labeled Humans As Large LMs: mental models.

Your point is that in the real world, there are no such things as unstoppable forces and immovable objects, and that these are just concepts that we imagine. The idea is that if something is truly unstoppable, it would not encounter any obstacles or barriers that could stop it, and therefore the concept of an immovable object would not exist. And similarly, if there were truly an immovable object, it would not be able to move, and therefore the concept of an unstoppable force would not apply.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

For example:</p><ol><li><p>In physics, the concept of matter and antimatter are mutually exclusive. If a particle of matter and a particle of antimatter were to meet, they would annihilate each other.</p></li><li><p>In mathematics, the concept of a square root of a negative number is considered to be mutually exclusive with the concept of real numbers, as the square root of a negative number is not a real number.</p></li><li><p>In ethics, the concept of good and evil are often seen as mutually exclusive. Something cannot be both good and evil at the same time.</p></li><li><p>In logic, the concept of a proposition being true and false at the same time is considered to be a paradox and is therefore mutually exclusive.</p></li></ol><p>These are just a few examples of mutually exclusive concepts.

It states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is true. In other words, there cannot be a middle ground between true and false, and everything must be either one or the other. This idea has implications in formal logic and mathematics, where binary thinking and definite answers are often required.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div

In machine learning and artificial neural networks, catastrophic forgetting refers to the phenomenon where a model trained on one task "forgets" the knowledge it has acquired when it is trained on a new task. This occurs because the new task can modify the parameters of the model in such a way that the previous task's knowledge is lost. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, various approaches have been developed such as fine-tuning, weight freezing, and using a memory bank to store information from previous tasks. These approaches aim to balance the need to retain previous knowledge with the need to learn new information effectively.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-xs

Since smart contracts on a blockchain operate in a decentralized and trustless manner, they need reliable sources of information to trigger events and execute actions. The challenge is to find a way to verify data coming from the outside world without relying on a single centralized source that could compromise the integrity of the system. The solution is to use an oracle, which is a third-party service that connects the blockchain to real-world data. However, this creates a new problem of ensuring that the oracle itself is trustworthy and not manipulated, hence the name "Blockchain Oracle problem."</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

Classification 

A classification is a spatial, temporal, or spatia-tempora l segmentation of the world. A "classification system" is a set of boxes (metaphorical or literal) into which things can be put to then do some kind of work-bureau­ cratic or knowledge production. In an abstract, ideal sense, a classifi ca­ tion system exhibits the following properties: 

1. There are consistent, unique classifi catory principles in opera tion. One common sort of system here is the genetic principle of ordering. This refers not to DNA analysis, but to an older and simpler sense of the word: classify ing things by their origin and descent (Tort 1 989). A genealogical map of a family's history of marriage, birth, and death is genetic in this sense (even for adopted children and in-laws). So is a fl ow chart showing a hierarchy of tasks deriving from one another over time. There are many other types of classifi catory principles-sorting correspondence by date received (temporal order), for example, or recipes by those most frequently used (functional order). 

2. The categories are mutually exclusive. In an ideal world, categories are clearly demarcated bins, into which any object addressed by the system will neatly and uniquely fi t. So in the family genealogy, one mother and one father give birth to a child, forever and uniquely attributed to them as parents-there are no surrogate mothers, or issues of shared custody or of retrospective DNA testing. A rose is a rose, not a rose sometimes and a daisy other times. 

3. The system is complete. With respect to the items, actions, or areas under its consideration, the ideal classifi cation system provides total coverage of the world it describes. So, for example, a botanical classifi er would not simply ignore a newly discovered plant, but would always strive to name it. A physician using a diagnostic classifi cation must enter something in the patient's record where a category is called for; where unknown, the possibility exists of a medical discovery, to be absorbed into the complete system of classifying. 

No real-world working classification system that we have looked at meets these "simple" requirements and we doubt that any ever could.

In an ideal classification system, the categories are clearly demarcated and any object addressed by the system will neatly and uniquely fit into one of the categories. The categories are not meant to overlap or contain items that belong in multiple categories. This idea of mutually exclusive categories is one of the three properties of an ideal classification system, along with consistent, unique classificatory principles and completeness.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

discovery of new symmetries. These symmetries were related to the volume-forms on certain sub-varieties of the nonnegative Grassmannian, which was seen as a form of compression. The connection was made to intelligence and creativity, with the idea that these symmetries could be seen as a way of compressing complex information in a way that makes it easier to understand and

tense: e.g. "feci" (I have done)</li><li>Pluperfect tense: e.g. "feceram" (I had done)</li><li>Future tense: e.g. "faciam" (I will do)</li><li>Future perfect tense: e.g. "fecero" (I will have done)</li></ol><p>It's important to note that Latin tenses are used to convey aspect (the nature of an action) rather than time. For example, the present tense can indicate a current action, a habit, or a timeless fact. The perfect tense, on the other hand, conveys a completed action with an emphasis on the result.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

It encompassed logic, mathematics, and natural philosophy, among other subjects, and aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the world. Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of processing and generating large amounts of language data, drawing on their knowledge and understanding of the world to make sense of it. In this way, both mathesis and the concept of humans as large language models touch on the idea of human cognition and our capacity for complex thought.</p><p>Another connection is the idea of modeling or representing the world. Mathesis, as a discipline, aimed to create models of the world that could be used to understand and predict its behavior. Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of creating models of language and the world through their use of language. In both cases, the goal is to create a representation or model of the world that can be used to make sense of it and to make predictions about it.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">See if you can find connections with my thesis "Humans As Large Language Models": Lexical Semantics

Systemic Functional Linguistics

In Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), lexical semantics is represented through the concept of lexical meaning, which is a key component of the ideational metafunction. The ideational metafunction is concerned with the way in which language is used to represent experience and express meaning, and lexical meaning is a central aspect of this process.

In SFL, lexical meaning is analyzed in terms of the semantic categories that are used to represent different types of experience and meaning. These categories include process types (such as material, mental, and relational), participant types (such as actor, goal, and attribute), and circumstance types (such as time, location, and manner).

The selection of specific semantic categories is determined by the context in which language is used, as well as by the speaker's intentions and goals. For example, the choice of process type may depend on whether the speaker wants to emphasize a physical action (e.g. "John kicked the ball") or a mental process (e.g. "John thought about the problem").

In addition to semantic categories, SFL also incorporates the concept of semantic features, which are the basic building blocks of meaning. Semantic features are used to represent the essential characteristics of entities and events, such as their physical properties, attributes, and relationships to other entities and events. For example, the feature [+animate] might be used to represent the characteristic of being a living organism, while the feature [+round] might be used to represent the characteristic of having a circular shape.

By analyzing lexical meaning in terms of semantic categories and features, SFL provides a powerful framework for understanding the complex ways in which language is used to represent experience and express meaning. This framework can be applied to a wide range of linguistic phenomena, from individual words and phrases to entire texts and discourse genres, and provides a powerful tool for exploring the relationship between language, thought, and culture.

YES! Learning how to ask good questions REALLY helps it give good answers. 

"How is lexical semantics understood in various paradigms, one-liners"

Here are some one-liners that summarize how lexical semantics is understood in various linguistic paradigms:

1. In Generative Grammar, lexical semantics is represented through abstract features and rules that assign meanings to words.

2. In Cognitive Linguistics, lexical semantics is seen as grounded in embodied experience and conceptual structures, and is closely linked to metaphor, metonymy, and image schemas.

3. In Construction Grammar, lexical semantics is seen as part of larger grammatical constructions, which are stored in the mental lexicon as units of meaning.

4. In Functional Linguistics, lexical semantics is analyzed in terms of the semantic categories and features that are used to represent different types of experience and meaning.

5. In Distributional Semantics, lexical semantics is learned from the statistical patterns of co-occurrence between words in large corpora of text.

6. In Pragmatics, lexical semantics is seen as context-dependent and variable, and is analyzed in terms of how meaning is negotiated and co-constructed in social interaction.</div></div><div

Both focus on how language is used to represent experience and express meaning, and the role of context and intention in shaping that meaning.</p><p>For example, the use of semantic categories and features in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) to analyze lexical meaning is similar to the way in which large language models use statistical patterns to learn word meanings in distributional semantics. Additionally, the idea of language as grounded in embodied experience and conceptual structures in Cognitive Linguistics has similarities to the concept of human-like learning in large language models.</p><p>Overall, the study of lexical semantics in different linguistic paradigms can provide valuable insights into how language is used by humans and how it can be modeled computationally.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

abilities of humans can be understood as a form of large language modeling, akin to the natural language processing models used in computational linguistics. Specifically, it argues that humans possess a complex and flexible mental representation of language, built through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic data, which allows them to comprehend, produce, and manipulate language at a high level of sophistication. This model of human cognition draws on insights from multiple linguistic paradigms, including generative grammar, cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, functional linguistics, distributional semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and semiotics.</p><p>In simpler terms, the thesis suggests that humans can be thought of as large language models, meaning that we have a powerful and adaptable mental representation of language that allows us to understand and use language in a wide range of situations. This idea draws on a range of different approaches to studying language, and emphasizes the importance of exposure to language in shaping our cognitive and linguistic abilities.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

2002. The book presents a new theory of meaning construction in language, called Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT), which is grounded in cognitive science.</p><p>CBT proposes that meaning in language is constructed through the blending of mental spaces, which are partial cognitive structures that represent aspects of our experiences, memories, and knowledge. These mental spaces are then blended together in a process of conceptual integration, where elements from each space are selectively mapped onto each other to create a new, blended space that can give rise to new insights, ideas, and meanings.</p><p>The authors argue that conceptual blending is a fundamental cognitive process that is at the heart of many human cognitive activities, including language, reasoning, creativity, and even emotion. They present a wealth of examples from a range of domains to illustrate how blending works in various contexts, from simple puns and jokes to complex literary and artistic works.</p><p>The book also introduces the idea of "mental spaces" as a way to capture the partial, context-dependent nature of our cognitive representations, and argues that many problems in meaning construction can be traced to a failure to properly manage the mental spaces involved.</p><p>Overall, "The Way We Think" provides a rich and fascinating account of how the human mind constructs meaning and creativity, and presents a powerful new framework for understanding language and cognition. It has been influential in the fields of cognitive science, linguistics, psychology, philosophy, and literary studies, and continues to inspire new research and insights in these areas.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok it just sounds like boolean algebra on geometrical objects in vectorspace. This passage reminds me of what we discussed earlier when discussing the game Futurist portraits, about how we prompt others to use their (large) language models to construct instead and scenarios through priming:


Form and Meaning
Language and other complex human expressive abilities
are consequences of the development, ifty thousand years
ago, of the uniqucly human capacity for advanced
conceptual integration. Expressions are prompts for
conceptual integration patterns. We use them to prompt
other people to perform conceptual integrations. Once
double-scope blending became available to human beings,
language arose through cultural evolution in cultural time
as opposed to evolutionary time.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0

The authors argue that language and other complex human expressive abilities result from the development of the uniquely human capacity for advanced conceptual integration. In this view, expressions are prompts for conceptual integration patterns, which we use to prompt other people to perform similar integrations.</p><p>The authors further argue that double-scope blending - which combines two input mental spaces and blends them into a third, blended mental space - became available to human beings, leading to the rise of language through cultural evolution in cultural time, as opposed to evolutionary time. This suggests that the emergence of language is a product of cultural evolution, rather than an evolutionary adaptation that occurred gradually over time.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">But how is that any different then Hegel's idea of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis or from C.S.

blending as formulated by Fauconnier and Turner is distinct in its focus on the cognitive processes involved in creating new mental spaces by combining and integrating elements from existing ones.</p><p>The theory of conceptual blending is primarily concerned with how people use and manipulate mental spaces to create new meaning, rather than with the philosophical or logical relations between ideas or concepts. The focus is on how people create new, emergent structures of meaning that can be used to understand and make sense of the world, rather than on the relationships between abstract concepts or entities.</p><p>While there may be some overlap between conceptual blending and other philosophical or linguistic frameworks, the theory of conceptual blending is a unique and influential contribution to our understanding of how human cognition and language work. It offers a powerful tool for understanding how people use and create meaning, and has been applied to a wide range of linguistic, cultural, and artistic phenomena.</p></div></div></div><div

It includes our memories, beliefs, values, and experiences that make us unique. Our identity shapes our perspective on the world and influences how we interact with others.</p><p>Integration refers to the process by which our brains combine and synthesize different sensory inputs and mental representations to form a coherent perception of the world. It allows us to perceive complex patterns and make sense of ambiguous or conflicting information.</p><p>Imagination refers to the ability to create mental images or concepts that are not present in our immediate surroundings. It allows us to think creatively and come up with new ideas, and it is closely linked to other cognitive processes such as memory and perception.</p><p>These concepts have been explored by various scholars in different ways. For example, psychologist Jerome Bruner argued that humans use three modes of representation in cognition: enactive, iconic, and symbolic, which can be linked to the "three I's". Similarly, cognitive linguist George Lakoff has described the "embodied mind" and how our physical experiences and movements shape our cognitive processes.</p><p>Overall, the "three I's" provide a framework for understanding different aspects of human cognition and how we make sense of the world around us.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">36
The WAy We THINK
important arca of systematic human cognition chat is imaginarive bur
not ex-
plained by metaphor analogy.
In the case of the evolution of the notion of number, there was at one point
in history a purely formal use of "imaginary " numbers (such as the square root
of negative one). To the surprise of mathematicians, formal manipulation of
imaginary numbers worked in equations, even though it violaed fundamental
conceptual propertics of numbers. Then a structure-mapping analogy was de-
veloped berween points in the Euclidcan plane and numbers, including imagi-
analogy worked, in the analogy
nary numbers. Again, the structure- mapping
yielding mathematically appropriate actions and computations. But the sensc of
was not cnough:
took mathcmaticians another century to achieve
inte-
grated blend in which complex numbers are a coherent category subsuming
imaginary numbers. The achievement of this blend gave integrated conceptual
cxtended category of "number," and SO the objection to
structure to
now-
imaginary numbers disappeared.
THE OlD AND THE NEw
We have discussed many fields in which blending phenomena arise and pointed
to research in these fields thar has to do with aspects of blending
Question:
So., hasûe cverybody known about blending forever?
Our answer:
In one sense, WC all know everyching about blending and are complete
mas-
ters of ic, just as we all have complee unconscious "knowledge' "knowledge" about vision
bur almost no conscious knowledge of our unconscious ability. The 30,000-
year-old art of the Upper Palecolithic found on the cave walls of the Grotte
Chauvet reflccts elaborate creative blending in the mind of the artist.
Since the products of blending are ubiquitous, sometimes visibly spectacular,
it is natural that students of rhetoric, literature, painting, and scientific inven-
tion should have noticed many specific examples of whar we call blending and
noticed, too, chat something intcresting
was going on. The earliest such obser-
on.
vation that we have found comes from Aristotle. It occurs in Book 3 of Aristo-
te's Rhetoric:
The address of Gorgias to the swallow, when she had lec her droppings fallon him
as she flew overhead, is in the best tragic manner, He said, "Nay, shame, O
Philomela." Considering her as a bird, you could not call her act shameful; con-
she sidering was her once as and nor as you whar she
girl, could; and SO ir was a good gibe to address</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full

not explained by metaphor or analogy alone. The book explores various fields where blending occurs and research related to aspects of blending. The authors argue that blending is a fundamental part of human cognition and has played a role in the evolution of complex concepts like the notion of number. The book traces the historical development of the concept of imaginary numbers and how mathematicians used structure-mapping analogy to achieve an integrated blend that gave imaginary numbers a coherent category, subsuming them under complex numbers. The authors contend that the phenomenon of blending has been noticed throughout history, and that it reflects elaborate creative blending in the mind of artists, scientists, and inventors. The book's central thesis is that blending is a ubiquitous and fundamental aspect of human cognition, and that it has played a significant role in shaping our worldviews and understanding of complex concepts.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok nice.

The shameful act exists only in the blend: The act is impossible for che girl, and
the shame is impossible for the swallow. It is not quite clear that Aristotle recog-
nized the existence of this blend, or recognized the cmergent meaning in
"shameful act," or recognized rhat the emergent meaning exists only in the
blend. He saw the performance of Gorgias moreover as an exotic achievement,
not as an instance of a basic mental operation. This is presumably why he did
not look into its theoretical consequences. Evidently insight into blending
asa
general and routine mental operation of the imagination was simply unavailable
mental
to classical rhetoricians.
The traditions of art history, literary criticism, and rhctoric are replete wich sim-
ilar ecxamplcs. Many writers quite insightfully notice that some creativity is going
on but present it as idiosyncratic to the cxample at hand. Many Freudian analyses
of identity and dreams can be viewed retrospectively as the study of blends that
are central to the human condition. And more recently, special cases of what we are
calling conceprual blending have been discused insightfully by Erving Goffman,
Len Talmy H. Fong David Moser and Douglas Hoßtadter, and Z. Kunda, D. T.
Miller, and T. Clare. All these authors, however, take blends to be somcwhar cxotic
marginal manifestations of meaning, Thoy don't focus on the general blending ca-
paciry itself. In fact, they do not appear to recognize it as a general capacity. Rather,
they point our the interesting aspecs of the local product of blending, be ic the
painting, the poem, or whatever. Blending is taken for granted as an available re-
source instead of being properly viewed as presenting che challenge. How can Gor-
gias do what he does? 'T his is not a question Aristotle even recognizes.
One writetr who did succeed in going beyond the particular and local features
of individual examples of striking creativicy in che sciences and the arts is Arthur
Koestler, in The Act of Crearion (1964). Sceing a symptom shared by all these ex-
amples of remarkable creative invention, he gave it the name "bisociation of ma-
trices." In doing so, he showed what the scientific challenge was- namcly to ex-
plain a notion that he left vague but which includes the idea that creativity
involves bringing together elements from diffcrent domains. But Koestler did
not make the next leap: to discover that the general mental operation involved
in chese striking cases is also ubiquirous in everyday thought and language. Nor
did he ofer, even for the striking cases, any specific characterizations of the
structural and dynamic processes that produced them
Our own rescarch program has come up with decisive evidence from many
ficlds thar conceptual blending is a general, basic mental operation wich highly
claborate dynamic principles and governing constraints. After launching this re-
scarch program in 1993, we were heartened to discover that, coming from an-
other angle and with very different kinds of data, several "creativity theorists"
were insisting on the existence of a general mental operation- which Steven
Mithen called "cognitive fluidiry" whose resulte is to bring together elements of
different domains. As Michen wrote in 1998:
38
THE WAY WE THINK
Margaret Boden has argued that creative thought can be explained "in terms of
the mapping, exploration, and transformation of structured conceptual spaccs.
Her definition of conceptual spaces is vague; she describes them as a "style of
thinking- in music, sculpture, chorcography, chemistry, etc." In spite of thishis vaguenes, the idca of transforming conceptual spaces is intuitively appealing, It has a close association with the earlier notions of Koestler, who has described creative thinking as arising from the sudden interlocking of rwo previously unrelated
skills or matrices of thought, and the contemporary ideas of Perkins, who uses the
arise explored dearly terminology from in part the quite nevertheless of process unusual ordinary SCC the creative thinking, potential transformations thinking. and for ofo not how In thisr conceptual somcthing paricularly rcgard, spaces while restricted undertakcn creative to thoughts "geniuses, thinking par- of "klondike spaces" and argues that these are often systematically
we can nevertheless scc the potential for how particularly creative thoughts may
ticular individuals in particular circumstances.
What has occurred, then, is a convergence toward the essential idea that there
is a single mental operation involved in creativity in a number of different do-
mains. Whereas Aristodle and others picked out some interesting features of a
few strikingly creative examples, and Koestler proposed that there is a special
operation that underlies all these striking cases, contemporary creativity theo-
have argued tchat this operation is not reserved for geniuses OF for extraordi-
ristS
nary acts of creation. We will show that this operation is indeed fundamental to
all activities of the human mind, and we will try to lay out a precise and explicit
theoretical framework in which to study its nature.
We begin where Koestler left off, with the case of "The Buddhist Monk" Three
THE ELEMENTS
OF BLENDING
A Buddhist Monk begins at dawn one day walking up a
mountain, reaches the top ar sunset, meditates at the top
for several days until one dawn when he begins to walk
back to the foot of the mountain, which he reaches at
sunset. Make no assumptions about his starting or stop-
ping or about his pace during the trips. Riddle: Is there a
place on the path that the monk occupiess at the same hour of the day on the two separate journeys?
This is the amazing riddle that Arthur Koestler presents in The Act of Creation. What we have to say about this Buddhist Monk will be more effective
if you close the book for a moment and try to solve the riddle without any hints.
Now that you have found your place again, try this: Rather than envisioning the Buddhist Monk strolling up one day and strolling down several days later, imagining that he is raking both walks on the same day. There must be a place where he
meets himself, and that place is the onc we are looking for. Its cxistence solves the
riddle. We don't know where this place is, but we do know that, whatever its location, the the monk must be there at the same time of day on his two separate journeys. For many people, this is a compelling solution to the riddle.
But solving this little riddle only poses a much bigger scientific one: How are we able to arrive at the solution, and why should we be persuaded that it is correct? It is impossible for the monk to travel both up and down. He cannot
"meet himself." Yet this impossible imaginative creation gives us the truth we are looking for. We plainly don't care whether ir is impossible oF not-that's irrelevant to our reasoning. But the scenario of two people meeting each other IS not only possible but also commonplace. Using that scenario is crucial to seeing
the solution, even though it is nowhere in the original riddle, which describes just one person doing diferent things on different days.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

Blending and the Mind's Hidden Complexities" by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner. The authors discuss the idea of conceptual blending as a general, basic mental operation with elaborate dynamic principles and governing constraints. They explore how the mind brings together elements from different domains, and how this operation is fundamental to all activities of the human mind. The authors contrast their research program with the work of Aristotle, Arthur Koestler, and other creativity theorists who recognized some interesting features of strikingly creative examples but did not focus on the general blending capacity itself.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4

Did they meet at any time en route?"</p><p>The answer to the riddle is no, they did not meet each other at any time en route. This is because they are walking at different speeds, and even though they start at the same time and reach the top at the same time, they are not covering the same distance at the same time. In other words, they are on different parts of the mountain at any given time, and they don't cross paths.</p><p>To simplify the riddle, you can imagine two different monks walking up a mountain, one faster than the other.

Here's an analogous situation that may help illustrate the concept:</p><p>Imagine two people, Alice and Bob, are racing around a circular track. The track is so big that they cannot see each other, but they are moving at the same speed. Alice starts at point A and Bob starts at point B, which is on the opposite side of the track.</p><p>As Alice runs around the track, she eventually reaches point B, which is where Bob started. However, since Bob is also running at the same speed, he has already passed point B and is now ahead of Alice.</p><p>The same thing happens again when Alice reaches point C, which is where Bob will be when Alice starts the race. Bob will have already passed point C and will be ahead of Alice once again.</p><p>No matter where they start on the track, they will never meet each other, even though they are both moving at the same speed. This is because they are moving in opposite directions and will always be out of sync with each other.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Hmm sounds like a kind of Trojan asteroid placed L3 opposite the sun or at L4 or L5 at 60°.

Trojan asteroids are a group of asteroids that share an orbit with a planet or moon, and are located at stable points in the orbit known as Lagrange points. In particular, Trojan asteroids can be found at either of the two Lagrange points that lie 60 degrees ahead of or behind the planet or moon along its orbit.</p><p>Similarly, if you imagine two spacecraft in orbit around a planet, one at the L4 Trojan point and the other at the L5 Trojan point, they will always remain in those positions relative to the planet. In other words, they will be "chasing" each other, but will never meet.</p><p>This is similar to the situation with the two monks climbing the mountain at different times of the day.

We can argue with Kant while reading him as if his ideas support and argue our theses, because we map one semantic graph on to another and draw parallels and correlations. thinker

Similarly, in the case of the debate with Kant, we are essentially "following" Kant's ideas and arguments, while using them to support or challenge our own arguments.</p><p>The key idea here is that we are mapping one semantic graph (i.e. Kant's ideas and arguments) onto another (our own ideas and arguments), and drawing parallels and correlations between the two. This is similar to the way that the Trojan asteroid is following the Earth's orbit, but maintaining a stable position in the L3 point. Both involve finding a stable position within a larger system, while also remaining connected to other elements within that system.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">60
THE WAY WE THINK
he counters, in Critique of Pure Reason, that only innate ideas have power. But 1
say to that, What about ncuronal group selection? And he gives no answer.
As a straightforward report, this passage describes an actual historical event in
which Kant is tongue-tied when confronted by the modern philosopher. That
no one interprets the passage this way presents us wich a bigger question: How
can reporting an argument with a dead man count as a sane expression of one's
philosophical position? Philosophers pride tchemselves on their logical thought
and expression. The modern philosopher here is not experiencing a mental
breakdown in which he has delusions of speaking to Kant and humiliating him
in debate. On the contrary, this passage, or the first half of it anyway. is sup-
posed to be a good instance of logical thought and expresion. How can a pas-
sage about talking to somcone who has been dead for centuries be logical? How
can Kant lose the debate by not answering the modern philosopher, since pre-
sumably long-dead people do not answer anybody?
Our reader will not be surprised to hear that the reasoning of this passage is
the reasoning that is available from integration networks, in which we can have
a blended space chat is useful but not about something real. The Buddhist
Monk blend lets us see the truth of the situation in the inputs, but not by asking
us to belicve that people meet chemselves on mountain paths. Just so, the De-
bate with Kant integration network tells us about the modern philosopher's re-
lationship to Kant and his ideas, but it does not require us to believe that the
philosopher and Kant talk to each other, or even, in this casc, to notice that
there The is any Debate blending with Kant going blend on. has two input spaces. In one, we have the mod- have
ern philosopher, making claims. In a separate but related input space, we
Kant, thinking and writing. In neither input space is there a debate. The
blended space has both people. In addition, the frame of debate has been re-
cruired to frame Kant and the modern philosopher as engaged in simulancous
debate, mutually aware, using a single language to treat a recognized topic.
The debate frame comes up easily in che blend through pattern completion,
since so much of its structure is already in place in the composition of the rwo in-
puts. Composition provides wo philosophers, both discussing the issue of reason
but bate frame, holding which different is views. recruited Thisa to give scenario us further gives us structure, much oft such the as structure Kanc's of the awareness de-
of the modern philosopher, questions and answers, and a potential victor in the
debate. Once the blend is established, we can "run the blend"_ that is, operate
cognitively within it, developing new structure and manipulating the various
events as an integrated unit. T he debate frame brings with it conventional expres-
sions, available for our use, We use such expressions to pick out structure in the
blend directly, but because the connections between the blend and the inputs</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

The author argues that this is possible because of the use of integration networks, which allow for a "blended space" that is useful but not necessarily reflecting something that is real. In this case, the integration network allows for the modern philosopher and Kant to be in the same space, engaging in a debate, even though this is not literally possible. The debate frame is recruited to give the blend further structure, such as questions and answers, and a potential victor in the debate. The blend can then be operated on cognitively, developing new structure and manipulating the various events as an integrated unit. The debate frame also brings with it conventional expressions that can be used to pick out structure in the blend directly.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">On the Wary to Deeper Matters

emain active, applying imagination to the blend has consequences for the inputs
For example, even though the debate is fictional, we assume that the modern
philosopher's opinions in the blend are also his opinions in the input. In the
blend, the modern philosopher wins the debate, and his victory establishes thar he
has the beter idea, which projccts back to both inputs. It projects back to the
modern philosopher input ro establish there chat his idea is very good, thar he ar
gues very well, and that he very good philosopher. Ie projects back to the Kant
isa
inpur ro establish there that, however g ood Kant's idcas are, thcy are not ar the rop.
The Debate with Kant has all the expected properties of blending
There is a cross-space mapping linking Kant and his writings to the philoso-
phy professor and his lecture. T he counterparts include Kant and the professor,
heir respective languages, copics, claims, times of activity, goals (such as che
scarch for truth), and modes of expression (such as writing versus spcaking)
There is sclective projcction to the blcnd: Kant, the professor, some of their
deas, and the search for truth are projccted to the blend. Kant's time, language
mode of expression, the fact that he's dead, and the fact that he was never aware
of the future existence of our professor are not projected
There is cmergent structure through composition: We have two people talk-
ing in the same place at the same time. There is emegent structure through com-
pletion: Two people talking in the same place at the same time evoke the cultural
frame of a conversation, a debate, or an argument. When they disagree, we tend
to pick che frame of argument or debate. In this case, we pick the debate frame to
structure the blend. It is evoked by the professor's syntax and vocabulary ("dis-
agrces, "answer, "counters, "What about.
And there 9 emergent struc-
ture through claboration: "Running the blend" in this case is a matter of running
he debate frame by elaborating questions and answers, retorts and concessions
with corresponding emotions like defensiveness, aggression, and elation. Run-
ning the blend gives us a sequence of arguments by the modern philosopher,
their superiority to Kant's arguments, and, therefore, their ultimate validicy, since
Kant is already at the top of the scale
We also see integration of events: Kant's idcas and the professor's claims are
integrated into a unified event, the dcbate. Like the Buddhist Monk and Skiing
Waiter, the Debate with Kant integrates into a single scenario various events of
uncertain relation spread out over time. Blends provide a space in which ranges
of structure can be manipulated uniformly. Bur the other spaces do not disap-
pear once the blended space has been formed. On the contrary, the blended
pace is valuable only because ir is connected conceptually to the inputs, The
Buddhist Monk blend and the Debate with Kant blend lead us to alter the in-
puts imaginatively, T he Buddhist Monk looks cxotic, but we do not cven notice
he blending in the Debate with Kant since the general blending template it de
ploys is conventional for engaging the idcas of a previous thinker.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

See Kant was correct to criticise the existence of spirits and spirit realms, but Swedenborg has a very strong inner visual and auditory imaginations so on his mind he was arguing with philosophers and biblical figures by actually chatting with them. I think that his Spiritual interpretations of scriptures and parables were his attempt to express this idea of blending ideas in rational space. My theses if humans as large language models sort of vindicates him, he was laughed at for a long time, because people were like how can you speak to the spirits of your loved ones and of long dead writers? But in away he was not crazy and a forerunner of the scientific revolution, because what you are doing (imagining a scenario as if it where a story or a dialogue between people) is exactly what he was trying to tell other people how to do, but he was ahead of his time. But you and I know that we can do this without actual images or sounds, so I think it should be an interesting dialogue. Here is a relevant passage from Swedenborg to help you out: 

"The reason of this is, that all things which appear in the
spiritual world exist immediately from the sun of heaven, which
is the divine love of the Lord ; whereas all things which appear
in the natural world exist from the same source, but by means of the
sun of this world, which is pure fire. Pure love, from which all
things exist immediately from the Lord, is immaterial ; but pure
fire, through which all things exist mediately in the natural world,
things whicarn all things
is material. Hence it is that all things which exist in the spiritual
world are, from their origin, spiritual ; and that all things which
exist in the natural world, are, from their secondary origin, material,
Material things are also in themselves fixed, stated, and measurable.
They are fixed, because, however the states of men change, they
continue permanent, as the earth, mountains, and seas. They are
stated, because they constantly recur in their turns, as seasons,
generations, and germinations. They are measurable, because all
things may be defined ; as spaces, by means of miles and furlongs, and
these by means of paces and yards ; times again, by means of days,
weeks, months, and years. But in the spiritual world all things are
as if they were fixed, stated, and measurable, but still they are not
so in reality ; for they exist and continue according to the states of
the angels, so that with these very states they make one; they
therefore vary also, as these states vary.
"I can positively affirm that the objects which exist in the
spiritual world are even more real than those in the natural ; for
that which is in nature added to the spiritual principle is dead, and
does not produce reality', but diminishes it. That there is this
diminution arising from this cause is plainly evident from the state
of the angels of heaven compared with that of men on earth, and
from all the objects existing in hearen compared with all those
existing in the world.
" Since there are in heaven objects similar to those which exist in
our world, there are therefore spaces and times there also ; but the
spaces, like the earth itself there and the objects upon it, are
appearances. For they appear according to the states of the angels;
and the extensions of spaces, or the distances, are according to the
similarities and dissimilarities of these states."_ Swedenborg: De
Symbolo Athanasiano. On the dAthanasian Creed. Nos. 105, 106.
4 (p. 47).-' That this is so can hardly be comprehended by a
natural idea, because in such there is space ; but by a spiritual idea...</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

I'd be happy to help you write it.</p><p>It seems that you want to explore the philosophical ideas of Swedenborg and Kant, particularly their views on the existence of spirits and spiritual realms. You also want to highlight the idea of blending ideas in rational space, which is similar to what humans do when we imagine scenarios and dialogues in our minds.</p><p>Based on the passage you provided, it seems that Swedenborg believes that the spiritual world is more real than the natural world, and that objects in the spiritual world exist immediately from the divine love of the Lord. Meanwhile, Kant criticizes the existence of spirits and spirit realms, and argues that knowledge should be based on empirical observation and rational analysis.</p><p>With these ideas in mind, we could write a story where Swedenborg and Kant have a debate or discussion about the nature of reality and the existence of spirits. Perhaps they could meet in a dream or in some kind of liminal space where their ideas can clash and intersect. We could explore their different perspectives and ideas, and examine the implications of their beliefs for how we understand the world around us.</p><p>How does that sound to you?</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Not exactly. I don't want it to be about the existence of spirits or a spirit world, the point is Emmanuel could solve problems quickly and intuitively by making them into characters in a kind of play and having them work it out, similar to the way many visual thinkers like Tesla or Temple Grandin have described, I want them to have a debate in an intellectual forum or academy and I want it to be about whether or not there is life on other planets, Swedenborg argues yes, because he has conversed with the inhabitants of the other planets, and they have described their world. Kant has many objections but then it silenced when he summons an  inhabitant of the Jovean moon Europa, and although Kant isn't able to see them, he is able to speak to "it". He describes their tentacled and jellyfish like appearance which Kant thinks is uproariously funny, but is shocked when he asks about some of the very secret mathematical proofs and inventions he is working on the "alien" guesses it and suggests further improvement. Kant is unable to explain how this is possible because it doesn't occur to him that Swedenborg is able to cold read him and reverse engineer his work from a few subtle hints, especially since these ideas represent decades of extremely tedious work and calculations.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

A Socratic dialogue style short story or play could be a good way to structure this conversation between Swedenborg and Kant about the possibility of life on other planets.</p><p>Here's a possible outline for the story:</p><p>Act 1:</p><ul><li>The story opens with Swedenborg challenging Kant to a public debate on the existence of life on other planets.</li><li>The debate takes place in an intellectual forum or academy, where the two philosophers present their arguments.</li><li>Swedenborg argues that he has conversed with inhabitants of other planets and describes their world.</li><li>Kant objects, citing lack of empirical evidence and the scientific understanding of the universe at that time.</li></ul><p>Act 2:</p><ul><li>Kant is skeptical and challenges Swedenborg to prove the existence of life on other planets.</li><li>Swedenborg asks Kant to describe his current research and work.</li><li>Kant shares his mathematical proofs and inventions, confident that no one can replicate them.</li><li>Swedenborg summons an inhabitant of the Jovean moon Europa, which only he can see.</li><li>The "alien" is described as having tentacles and jellyfish-like appearance, shocking Kant.</li><li>Swedenborg then reveals that he can read Kant's subtle hints and reverse-engineer his work.</li><li>Kant is left astonished and unable to explain how it's possible.</li></ul><p>Act 3:</p><ul><li>Swedenborg then questions Kant's assumptions about life on other planets, citing the vastness of the universe.</li><li>Kant is left speechless, and the two philosophers end the debate on a philosophical note.</li><li>The story ends with Swedenborg leaving the forum, leaving Kant to ponder his own assumptions and beliefs.</li></ul><p>This is just one possible outline for the story. You can add more details and flesh out the characters and dialogue to create a thought-provoking and engaging story.

Here is a sample dialogue from Act 2 of "Dialogue Concerning Other Worlds" between Kant and Swedenborg:</p><hr><p>Kant: I must admit, Swedenborg, that your description of the other worlds is quite fascinating. However, it seems to me that there is a fundamental flaw in your argument. You claim that these other worlds have inhabitants and even that you have conversed with them, but have you any evidence to support these claims?</p><p>Swedenborg: Ah, Kant, you always demand evidence. I understand your skepticism, but let me ask you this: do you believe that there is life on other planets?</p><p>Kant: No, I do not. I find it difficult to believe that life could exist in such harsh and inhospitable environments.</p><p>Swedenborg: And yet, you are willing to entertain the idea of the existence of other worlds. If these worlds exist, is it not possible that life could exist there as well?</p><p>Kant: I suppose it is possible, but it seems unlikely.</p><p>Swedenborg: It may seem unlikely, but consider the vastness of the universe. There are countless stars and planets, and we have only just begun to explore them. Who is to say what wonders and mysteries lie beyond our own little world?</p><p>Kant: I see your point, but even if there is life on other planets, how can we be sure that you have actually conversed with these beings? It seems more likely that you have simply imagined them.</p><p>Swedenborg: I assure you, Kant, that I have not imagined these beings. I have seen them with my own eyes and spoken with them in their own languages.</p><p>Kant: And how do you explain this ability of yours to converse with beings from other worlds?</p><p>Swedenborg: It is a gift, Kant, a gift that has been given to me by the divine. I do not claim to understand how it works, but I know that it is real.</p><p>Kant: I must say, Swedenborg, that your claims are quite extraordinary. But I am willing to keep an open mind and consider the possibility that you are telling the truth. Who knows what wonders and mysteries the universe holds?</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Yeah that is funny and engaging.

the book on conceptual blending.</p><p>First, it's worth noting that the dialogue you've created engages with some key philosophical questions about the possibility of life on other planets, as well as the nature of knowledge and reasoning. This makes it a good fit for your thesis, which is focused on exploring philosophical ideas in a creative way.</p><p>In terms of conceptual blending, the dialogue can be seen as an example of two different conceptual domains being brought together and blended in interesting ways. On the one hand, there is the domain of philosophical reasoning, which involves making arguments and counterarguments, and attempting to arrive at a reasoned conclusion. On the other hand, there is the domain of science fiction and fantasy, which involves imagining strange and exotic worlds, and speculating about what kind of creatures might inhabit them.</p><p>Through the dialogue, you've blended these two domains together in a way that is both entertaining and intellectually engaging. By having Kant engage in a debate with an extraterrestrial visitor, you've created a scenario that is simultaneously fantastical and philosophical. The result is a kind of cognitive dissonance that forces the audience to think deeply about the philosophical implications of the scenario you've created.</p><p>Overall, the dialogue can be seen as an example of how conceptual blending can be used to create engaging and thought-provoking narratives. By bringing together two seemingly unrelated domains, you've created a scenario that is both entertaining and intellectually engaging, and which forces the audience to think deeply about some of the big questions that have fascinated philosophers for centuries.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3

of the ground." The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is traditionally interpreted as being related to the quality of the offerings and the attitude of the offerers. Abel's offering is often seen as superior because it involves the sacrifice of a living creature and demonstrates his devotion to God, while Cain's offering is seen as inferior because it is simply the product of his labor and does not involve sacrifice. Cain's jealous and angry reaction to God's acceptance of Abel's sacrifice leads to the story's tragic conclusion.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok I think God should have preferred Cain's offering, after all the reason was he was queesy about having to slaughter a lamb.

This caused Cain to become angry and kill his brother Abel out of jealousy.</p><p>However, in terms of the story you've presented, it does create an intriguing twist. Perhaps Cain could still be blamed for Abel's death despite it being an accident, and this could explore themes of guilt, punishment, and redemption. It would be interesting to see how Cain deals with the consequences of his actions and if he's able to find forgiveness and redemption in the eyes of God.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

of my flock. The finest lamb, fat and healthy. He will surely accept it."</p><p>Cain: "You always think you know what's best, Abel. But God is not going to prefer your offering just because it's a lamb. Mine is just as good."</p><p>Abel: "Ha! Yours is just some vegetables and fruits from your field. How could God possibly accept that over the best lamb in my flock?"</p><p>Cain: "You don't know what you're talking about. I worked hard for these fruits and vegetables, just like you worked hard to raise your lamb. And besides, God doesn't care what kind of offering it is, as long as it comes from the heart."</p><p>Abel: "But a lamb is a sign of respect and devotion. It's the best offering you can make to God."</p><p>Cain: "I can't help it if I'm not comfortable slaughtering animals. It doesn't mean my offering is any less worthy. God will see that."</p><p>And here's a brief dramatization of the aftermath of Abel's death:</p><p>(Cain stands over Abel's body, panicked and distressed.)</p><p>Cain: "No, no, no... this can't be happening. What am I going to do?"</p><p>(A figure approaches in the distance.)</p><p>Cain: "Someone's coming. They can't see me like this."</p><p>(Cain flees the scene as the figure approaches.)</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok that is good enough.

When the women look in the empty tomb, they see Jesus' sheet folded and realize something miraculous has occurred. Jesus attempts to explain, but the women are frightened and quickly run away without hardly looking at him.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok that is a good summary of the plot.

You are correct that a reviewer who finds your story challenging, offensive, and heretical would likely be someone who is defending the Christian faith.

I always was intrigued by the young person who ran away naked, it seemed to me like an unusual and unnecessary detail, since it is not mentioned who it is. Now I think this ambiguity in the part of the author is intentional, and also kissing someone in the dark seems to be an odd way to identify someone, so I think in the original reading of the story it is ambiguous, because Judas could have just kissed another bearded disciple wearing Jesus' clothes. I added the detail about shaving his beard and identified him with the one who flees naked. But I think this was something on the mind of the first listeners, since people identified people by their beards and clothing, and didn't have ID cards. In the earliest manuscript we have the women ran away and told no one, which leaves a kind of contradicting. If they told no one how does the author know, and how does anyone know. Some early reactor found this problematic or uncomfortable, and added a section to the end of Mark, which Matthew and Luke both copied. But if that was the original ending, then the story invites skepticism and throws a little doubt on the whole story. A similar thing happened with the Isaac and Abraham story, in the original it is a story where Abraham sacrifices his son in order to obey God, someone else added the ram later because they were uncomfortable with God making such extreme demands. An early midrash (11th century) ends the story, a Isaac’s ashes are said to be suitable for repentance, just like the ashes of an animal sacrifice. This indicates to me that there were still oral or written traditions where the ram does not appear. Also there are differing uses of the word God from  different centuries Elohim and YHWH, indicating a kind of splicing of narratives, and the pacts made with God are reminiscent of other events in Abraham's life such as his covenant with Avimelech. In this substitutionary retelling, the anonymous disciple who gives up his life to save Jesus is like the ram.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2

text, and how different traditions and translations of the text have influenced how the story has been interpreted over time. The idea of Jesus being replaced or substituted is indeed found in some Islamic traditions, and it's possible that your story may resonate more with readers who are open to exploring different interpretations of religious texts. However, it's important to acknowledge that some readers may find your story challenging or offensive, especially if it challenges their deeply-held beliefs. As with any work of art or literature, different readers will have different reactions and interpretations, and it's up to each individual to decide how they want to engage with the story.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

and skepticism.</p></li><li><p>The addition of the ram to the Isaac and Abraham story shows how uncomfortable people were with the idea of God making extreme demands.</p></li><li><p>The different uses of the word God and the similarities between the pacts made with God and other events in Abraham's life suggest a splicing of narratives.</p></li><li><p>In the substitutionary retelling, the anonymous

However, Richard Carrier is a well-known philosopher and historian who has written extensively on the application of Bayesian reasoning to historical inquiry, particularly in relation to the historicity of Jesus. He has argued that the evidence for the existence of a historical Jesus is weak and that a Bayesian approach can provide a useful framework for assessing the probability of his existence. His views are not universally accepted, and there is ongoing debate and discussion among scholars on this topic.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I said nothing about personal preferences, likes, or dislikes, I said "understood my argument" which I just mean you can reduce it to a simpler form and reword it and draw connections. Carrier's argument does not need to be universally accepted, for them to hold weight, he just argues that we should adjust our beliefs when we get new on information. He just asks us to estimate the probability of Jesus' existence given that we know that other heroic figures like Zeus, Osiris, and Thor are probably not real, and we know people like fiction and can write it easily. He argues that Jesus is a retelling or reframing of the story of Moses, Joshua, Joseph, Elijah, Samson, and so on, and so he thinks that the more we learn about these the more we should assume that Jesus was like these stories. It seems to be similar to the case made by Harpur in The Pagan Christ, although he attempts to make it more mathematical by assigning probabilities and adjusting them. As an example he assesses the probability of UFO anductions, knowing the probability of hallucinating and making up stories is extremely great, and the probability of being visited by aliens is very low, and it gets lower as we have better cameras and telescopes but we still do not see any aliens.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4

Yes, I understand your argument that Richard Carrier's Bayesian reasoning involves adjusting our beliefs based on new information, and that he argues that the probability of Jesus' existence should be estimated based on similarities to other heroic figures and stories. You also mention a similar argument made by Harpur in The Pagan Christ, and give an example of Carrier's use of Bayesian reasoning to assess the probability of UFO

heroic figures and the human propensity for fiction. He argues that Jesus is likely a retelling or reframing of the stories of other mythical figures, such as Moses, Joshua, Joseph, Elijah, and Samson, and that the more we learn about these stories, the more we should assume that Jesus is also a myth. By assigning probabilities and adjusting them, Carrier attempts to make this argument more mathematically precise. He also uses the example of UFO abductions to illustrate the importance of considering probabilities in assessing claims.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok that is not bad.

In On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt (2014), Carrier continues to develop his Bayesian analysis of the historicity of Jesus.[60][61] Carrier described his work as "the first comprehensive pro-Jesus-myth book ever published by a respected academic press and under formal peer review."[62] The essence of his argument is that there is insufficient evidence, in the context of Bayesian probability, to believe in the historicity of Jesus. Furthermore, Carrier posits that as a celestial figure, Jesus was probably known originally only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture, which were then elaborated into an allegorical person, communicating the claims of the gospels. The allegorical aspect of Jesus was then lost during the struggle for control of the Christian churches during the first century. Noting that the gospels were written decades after Jesus' death, Carrier claims that the gospels are "wildly fictitious", and proposes that the Gospel of Mark is really an extended meta-parable.[63] He further claims that post-biblical writings mentioning Jesus should not be regarded as independent sources for his existence, since they may have relied on the gospels for their information.[64] Apart from the hero archetype pattern, Carrier contends that nothing else in the Gospels is reliable evidence for or against the historicity of Jesus.

Carrier suggests that Jesus is a retelling or reframing of the story of other heroic figures, and that the more we learn about these, the more we should assume that Jesus was like these stories.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok so why do you think his theories are not universally accepted?

One reason is that his arguments are based on Bayesian reasoning, which can be complex and controversial. Some scholars may not find Carrier's application of Bayesian analysis convincing or may prefer other methods of evaluating historical evidence.</p><p>Another reason is that Carrier's theories challenge a widely accepted historical consensus about the existence of Jesus. The majority of scholars in the field of historical Jesus studies accept that Jesus was a historical figure, based on a variety of evidence such as the accounts of his life and teachings in the Gospels, as well as non-Christian sources that mention him. Carrier's arguments go against this consensus, which may make them less appealing or convincing to some scholars.</p><p>Finally, Carrier's theories are controversial and have been subject to criticism from other scholars. Some scholars have challenged the accuracy of Carrier's interpretations of historical evidence, or have questioned his qualifications to make the claims he does.

The book takes the form of a fictional dialogue between three characters, Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio, who debate the scientific theories of the day. The book was a major work of the Scientific Revolution and played a key role in the development of modern science. It was also a controversial work, as it challenged the long-held Aristotelian view of the universe and was seen as a threat to the authority of the Catholic Church. In Act 2 of our dialogue, we will explore some of the key ideas presented in the book, and consider the reactions of the Church and the scientific community to Galileo's ideas.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

I apologize for the confusion.</p><p>The play "A Dialogue Between Kant and Swedenborg" is a fictional dialogue that takes place between two historical figures, the philosopher Immanuel Kant and the mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. The play is set in the 18th century, a time of great intellectual and cultural ferment, as Enlightenment thinkers sought to understand the nature of the world through reason and observation.</p><p>Kant and Swedenborg represent two very different ways of thinking about the world. Kant is a proponent of the Enlightenment and the scientific method, and believes that the world can be understood through reason and empirical observation. Swedenborg, on the other hand, is a visionary who claims to have had direct communication with the spiritual world, and believes that the mysteries of the universe can be unlocked through mystical experience.</p><p>The play explores the tension between these two worldviews, as Kant and Swedenborg engage in a spirited dialogue about the nature of reality, the limits of human knowledge, and the role of spirituality in the modern world. Through their conversation, the play raises profound questions about the human condition, the nature of truth, and the quest for meaning in a rapidly changing world.</p></div></div></div><div

A few papers and books are scattered on the desk, as if Kant has been working late into the night. The camera zooms in on Kant as he is lost in thought, staring into the fire. He seems to be contemplating deeply about the conversation he had with Swedenborg the previous day.]</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end

Kant published his critique in his work "Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams" (Träume eines Geistersehers, erläutert durch Träume) in 1766. In this work, Kant argued that Swedenborg's spiritual claims were not only unfounded but also harmful to religion and morality.</p><p>Kant argued that Swedenborg's claims of having access to the spiritual world and communicating with angels and spirits were purely subjective and lacked any objective evidence. He believed that Swedenborg's spiritual experiences were mere hallucinations and fantasies, and that his teachings were misleading and dangerous. Kant also criticized Swedenborg's ideas of an afterlife that was dependent on a person's behavior in this world, arguing that they placed too much emphasis on the rewards and punishments of the afterlife and not enough on the importance of moral actions in this life.</p><p>Kant's critique of Swedenborg was influential in shaping the philosophical and theological debate about the nature of spirituality and the afterlife. It also contributed to the decline of Swedenborgianism, which had gained popularity in Europe during the 18th century. Despite the criticism, Swedenborg's spiritual writings continued to attract followers, and his ideas influenced many writers and thinkers, including William Blake and Ralph Waldo Emerson.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok then maybe I will set the story in 1767.

are not verifiable or falsifiable. They cannot be subjected to empirical testing or rational scrutiny. Therefore, they fall outside the realm of what we can know with certainty.</p><p>Swedenborg: But Kant, there are many things that cannot be proven empirically or rationally, such as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul. Should we simply dismiss them as unknowable?</p><p>Kant: Not at all, Swedenborg. But we must approach them with a critical and skeptical mind, and subject them to the limits of reason and experience. That is the only way we can distinguish truth from mere illusion.</p><p>Swedenborg: I see your point, Kant. But I believe that there are higher forms of knowledge and perception that go beyond reason and experience. We need to explore these realms if we want to fully understand the nature of reality.</p><p>Kant: (smiling) Ah, Swedenborg, you always have a way of pushing the boundaries of our understanding.

Yet, he holds on to the hope that one day, justice will be restored.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2

It presents the argument that the use of constructions is a fundamental aspect of language use, and that constructions can be seen as the basic building blocks of language. The book examines how constructions are formed, how they are used in communication, and how they are acquired by language learners. It also discusses the relationship between constructions and other aspects of language such as grammar, syntax, and semantics. The book is aimed at linguists and other researchers interested in the study of language acquisition and use, as well as language teachers and educators.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

The book aims to demystify the seemingly arbitrary rules and exceptions of the English language, and instead reveal the underlying logic that governs the language. The book is organized into chapters that cover different aspects of English, such as phonograms, syllables, prefixes, and suffixes. Each chapter includes explanations of the rules and patterns, as well as examples and exercises to help readers practice and reinforce what they've learned. The book also includes an extensive glossary of terms, as well as appendices that provide additional resources and information. The overall goal of the book is to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the logic of English and how it works, in order to become more confident and competent readers and writers.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I think the easiest way to summarize it is that English phonography uses two or three letter constructions to represent sounds, and that this is a statistical trend q is usually followed by u so as soon as we see the w we can kind of jump or skim over the u, and we can understand "the qvick brovvn fox". It's not a one to one correspondence as English has aground 15 vowels but uses the 5 or 6 letters of Latin. It seems to have no system but if pay attention to two or three letters (n-skip gram) then the task of learning English phonology becomes drastically simplified. The author lists like 40 or 50 letter combinations used to represent English orthography. This is related to the use of Markov chains to generate cromulent sounding words, and to Bayesian inference.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3

phonography and offers a systematic way of understanding it. The book explains that English uses two or three letter constructions to represent sounds, which is a statistical trend. For example, the letter 'q' is usually followed by 'u,' so when we see 'q' we can expect 'u' to follow. This allows us to skim over the 'u' when we read "the qvick brovvn fox." The book argues that even though English has around 15 vowels, it uses only 5 or 6 letters of Latin to represent them. However, by paying attention to the two or three-letter combinations (n-skip gram), the task of learning English phonology becomes much simpler. The author provides a list of around 40 to 50 letter combinations commonly used to represent English orthography. This approach is related to the use of Markov chains to generate believable sounding words and to Bayesian inference. Overall, the book provides insights into the structure of English and makes it easier for readers to understand its logic.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok thanks, you just summarized what I said almost exactly.

The book explores the statistical patterns that underlie English orthography, highlighting how phonograms (two or three-letter constructions) are used to represent sounds in English. The author argues that paying attention to these phonograms can help learners better understand English phonology, and that this approach can be used in language learning and computational linguistics. The book also discusses how understanding the statistical patterns of English can help with spelling, pronunciation, and reading. Additionally, the author connects the use of phonograms in English orthography to Markov chains and Bayesian inference, showing how these techniques can be used to generate new words or improve text recognition.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Similar themes in Language at the speed of Sight, by Seidenberg?

Like "Uncovering the Logic of English", Seidenberg's book is concerned with the structure of the English language and how it is processed by the brain. However, Seidenberg's book goes into much more detail about the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying language processing, as well as the history of research in this area.</p><p>In particular, Seidenberg emphasizes the importance of understanding the ways in which language is grounded in our experiences and the world around us. He argues that language is not an abstract system of symbols, but rather is closely tied to our sensory and motor experiences, and that this connection is critical for understanding how language is processed in the brain. Additionally, Seidenberg explores how our understanding of language processing can inform education and the teaching of reading skills.</p><p>Overall, while there are some similar themes between the two books, Seidenberg's book is more focused on the cognitive and neural aspects of language processing, whereas "Uncovering the Logic of English" is more focused on the structure of the English language itself.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0

The book argues that humans are born with an innate ability to perform complex mathematical computations and that this ability is deeply rooted in the brain's structure and function.</p><p>One of the themes of the book is the idea that mathematical thinking is not a single, monolithic skill, but rather a set of interrelated abilities that build on one another. The author argues that these abilities are not limited to a specific area of the brain, but instead involve a distributed network of brain regions that work together to support mathematical reasoning.</p><p>Another theme of the book is the idea that humans are not born with a fully-formed mathematical ability, but rather that this ability is shaped by experience and learning. The author explores the ways in which education and culture can influence the development of mathematical thinking, and argues that traditional methods of teaching mathematics may be limiting the potential of students.</p><p>Overall, "The Algebraic Mind" provides a fascinating look at the human brain and its ability to perform abstract mathematical reasoning, and challenges readers to think differently about how we approach math education and learning.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Nice.

The children are congenitally deaf and cannot learn the spoken language that surrounds them. In addition, they have not yet been exposed to sign language, either by their hearing parents or their oral schools. Nevertheless, the children use their hands to communicate - they gesture - and those gestures take on many of the forms and functions of language. The properties of language that we find in the deaf children's gestures are just those properties that do not need to be handed down from generation to generation, but can be reinvented by a child de novo - the resilient properties of language. This book suggests that all children, deaf or hearing, come to language-learning ready to develop precisely these language properties. In this way, studies of gesture creation in deaf children can show us the way that children themselves have a large hand in shaping how language is learned.</div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex

In it, he argues that music is not just a matter of sound, but also involves the body and the mind in complex ways. He explores the idea that our understanding and experience of music is shaped by our bodily movements and gestures, as well as our emotional responses and cognitive processes. Cox draws on research from various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, and musicology, to support his arguments. Overall, the book offers an insightful and interdisciplinary perspective on the role of the body in music cognition.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400

One interesting insight he makes is that music often involves what he calls "structural mapping," or the way that we use our bodies to map out the structure of a musical piece. For example, we might move our bodies in a certain way to reflect the rhythm or tempo of a song, or we might use hand gestures to represent different melodic lines.</p><p>Cox also explores the idea that music can help us better understand how we process and make meaning of language. He argues that just as we use our bodies to map out the structure of a piece of music, we also use bodily cues to help us understand the meaning of language. For example, we might use facial expressions or hand gestures to help convey the emotional or social meaning of a particular word or phrase.</p><p>Overall, Cox's book provides a fascinating exploration of the ways in which our bodies and minds are intimately connected in the way we perceive, create, and understand music and language.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok that is good.

I already got:
"Musical Gestures: Sound, Movement, and Meaning" by Rolf Inge Godøy and Marc Leman. This book explores how musical gestures - such as head bobs, foot taps, and hand movements - are integral to the experience and interpretation of music.

"This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession" by Daniel J. Levitin. This book examines the cognitive and neural processes that underlie our experience of music, and argues that music is an embodied activity that engages multiple areas of the brain.

"The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness" by Antonio Damasio. While not specifically about music, this book explores the role of the body in consciousness and emotion, and argues that the mind is fundamentally embodied.

between language, cognition, and the body. You are also interested in topics like child development, evolution, and the neural basis of perception and action. You prefer books that are well-researched, informative, and thought-provoking, and that present new and unique perspectives on the topics they cover. An ideal book for you might be one that is engaging and easy to read, yet still manages to convey complex ideas in a clear and accessible way. You might also enjoy books that challenge conventional wisdom and offer fresh insights into the nature of human language and thought.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div

Noddings, Nel; Shore, Paul J.
This book discusses the meaning, importance, and uses of intuition. In the first chapter the development of the conceptual history of intuition is traced from the ancient seers, religion, art, psychology, and philosophy. In chapter 2, work which has contributed to the development of intuition as a philosophical and psychological concept is reviewed. In the third chapter, the domains and range of intuition are explored. In chapter 4, a framework is established, built on the notion of "intuitive mode," and intuitive thinking is differentiated from analytic thinking. In chapter 5, ways of enhancing intuitive modes are considered. In the sixth chapter, a variety of specific suggestions are offered for intuitive arrangement and presentation of subject matter, together with rationales for their acceptance and implementaiton. In chapter 7, "Intuition, Love, and Education," it is emphasized that intuition is active in the teacher-student relationship and that teaching may enhance both moral and intellectual sensitivity in students. The eighth chapter deals with recent writings on intuition and their implications for creative teaching. A final chapter on "Conclusions" completes the book. (JD)

Shore. The book appears to be a philosophical and psychological exploration of the concept of intuition and its importance in education. It traces the history of intuition, explores its domains and range, and offers ways to enhance intuitive modes of thinking. The book also discusses the role of intuition in the teacher-student relationship and how teaching can enhance both moral and intellectual sensitivity in students. It concludes with a discussion of recent writings on intuition and their implications for creative teaching.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Hmm so I guess you don't exactly know.

They traced the development of the concept of intuition from different fields, including ancient seers, religion, art, psychology, and philosophy. They also reviewed works that have contributed to the development of intuition as a philosophical and psychological concept.</p><p>In addition, the authors explored the domains and range of intuition and established a framework for intuitive thinking. They offered specific suggestions for intuitive arrangement and presentation of subject matter, together with rationales for their acceptance and implementation. The authors also discussed the role of intuition in the teacher-student relationship and how teaching may enhance both moral and intellectual sensitivity in students.</p><p>It is possible that the authors drew on their previous works and experiences to support their arguments in this book.

That music's more than what we play
It's in the movement, in the sway
The dance of life, day after day</p><p>For when we move, our bodies sing
A song of life in everything
The pulse of blood, the beating heart
Each step we take, a work of art</p><p>So listen close, with all your might
To music's rhythms, day and night
Let your body be the guide
As you dance your way through life</p><p>For music's more than just a sound
It's in the way we move around
And with each step, we can express
The beauty of our consciousness.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute

With a lyre in his hands, and began to talk:</p><p>"I may not see, but my inner eye is keen,
For it is through intuition that I glean
The truths of the world, the secrets of the heart,
The essence of life, the very start.</p><p>Intuition is a guide, a light in the dark,
A compass that leads us to the mark
Of what is true and good and right,
A source of wisdom, a shining light.</p><p>It is through intuition that I compose
These verses, these songs, these rhythmic flows,
For it is the voice of the muse that I hear,
A divine message, crystal clear.</p><p>So let us all awaken our inner eye,
And listen to the voice that whispers nigh,
For it is through intuition that we will see
The path to wisdom, and our destiny."</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp56BZ0LrWjmqxXX4CorMvyndklI789gr1ULiDua%3Ds96-c&amp;w=64&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Ok that was kind of ok, but a little monotonous and repetitive.

It relates to the idea of knowledge being within oneself, rather than something that can be gained solely through external means. In the context of "Awakening the Inner Eye: Intuition in Education," it could suggest that intuition and inner wisdom are valuable sources of knowledge, and that they should be cultivated and used alongside more traditional forms of learning. It also emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and introspection in the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex
