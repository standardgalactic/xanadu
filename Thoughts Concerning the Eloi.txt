My goodness, this is frightening.  WANTS everyone to become Eloi.

In the context of Pokemon Go I said that people are behaving like children. A confluence of evidence.

"Work is for robots so that we may play"

Monica Anderson, July 13, 2016

Understanding Machines ("AI") and better robots will make many kinds of jobs obsolete and will make entirely new categories of jobs available.

There will be a net loss of repetitive jobs and we will share the work that is left with shorter hours; many people in Sweden only work 6 hour days, and short work weeks are not uncommon in Europe.

A valid path forward would be successively shorter working hours and sharing jobs with others, until we reach a level we are happy with.

But some people holding jobs that robots could easily do would resent being laid off – even if they were able to maintain their standard of living through a guaranteed minimum income of some kind.

Because their work may be the only thing that gives them a sense of accomplishing something.

But what if everyone found more than one way to accomplish something, to finish something, to make some progress on something... every day.

If work was just one of a handful of things you would typically accomplish in a day, then losing a job might not hurt as much. "I accomplished dinner". "I aced my exam in the MOOC". "I managed two more sit-ups". "I leveled again in my game".

We all need to diversify our lives a bit. Social media, games, volunteer efforts, education, traveling the world, community work, time with family, direct improvement of personal standard of living, and random acts of kindness will provide the sense of meaning and accomplishment we need in life.

"Work is for robots so that we may Pokemon"

Many people may find it ridiculous and may refuse to acknowledge it, but they will feel a sense of accomplishment when they bag a Pikachu and this will keep them happy for a day :-).

We need (and will get) more alternative ways to find self-worth. Some of these will be less useful than others; but that's also true for work today. A protestant work ethic was required because there was nobody else to do the work; we had no robots. It's time to let go of that.

The task of Art is to lift man from the realm of mere things to the realm of values, to create out of the materials of the world around us something which is not world but a value, to make something new and beautiful, not for its own sake, but as a revelation of the beauty and value of the world which we might not otherwise see."

J.R.R. Tolkien said that quote in his essay "On Fairy-Stories", which was first delivered as a lecture at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland in 1939 and later published in a book of the same name in 1947.

It was collection of essays discussing the nature of fantasy and fairy-tales, and the role of such stories in human culture. It also includes his famous definition of the "fantasy" as a "sub-creation" which he calls "a secondary world".

I apologize, I misspoke in my previous response. The quote you provided is not something J.R.R. Tolkien said, I must have mixed it with something else in my database.

Unfortunately, there is no known quotes from him with such a specific wording as you've described. I apologize for any confusion that my previous response might have caused. 

Can you please give me more context about this quote so I can help you with more accurate information.

** 𝘎𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘪𝘵 𝘢𝘯 𝘦𝘹𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘱𝘵 **

The quote is discussing the common belief that there is a natural connection between children's minds and fairy stories, and that they are particularly suited to each other.

The speaker suggests that this is an error, and that it is often made by those who view children as a special or different kind of being, rather than as normal members of the human family. 

They suggest that people have false sentiment on the connection between children and fairy tales.

** 𝘐 𝘨𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘪𝘵 𝘢 𝘣𝘪𝘵 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 **

This passage is from J.R.R. Tolkien's essay "On Fairy-Stories," in which he discusses the value and function of fairy-stories as a form of literature.

He argues that fairy-stories, as a branch of a genuine art, have a unique value and function beyond what is found in other forms of literature.

He emphasizes the importance of fantasy in fairy-stories, explaining that the ability to create mental images of things not actually present is called imagination and that fantasy is the use of imagination in a way that creates images that are "not to be found in our primary world at all, or are generally believed not to be found there."

He also argues that fantasy is a higher form of art than other forms of literature because it is more challenging to achieve and that it often remains undeveloped or only used half-seriously.

The Eloi versus the Morlocks

The Eloi, fair and free,
With tales of wonder in their heads, 
They dance and sing and play,
With curiosity that never ends.

But the Morlocks, dark and cold,
See play and wonder as a curse,
They scoff at tales of old,
And label curiosity as worse.

But the Eloi know the truth,
That the spark of wonder never fades,
It's the fuel for the fire of youth,
And the key to the future's doors.

For without that childlike gleam,
We'd never reach beyond the stars,
Or dare to dream,
Of the wonders yet to be ours.

So let the Morlocks scoff and sneer,
At the Eloi's enchanted view,
For in the end, it is clear,
That the Eloi will see their dreams come true.

They'll create, explore, and seek
And in the end, succeed,
While the Morlocks will forever stay bleak
For they'd choose not to proceed.

** 𝘞𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘦 𝘪𝘵 𝘢𝘴 𝘢 1985 𝘴𝘤𝘪-𝘧𝘪 𝘮𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘦 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘳 **

In a world where the line between science and fiction has blurred, the Eloi and the Morlocks are locked in a battle for control of the future.

The Eloi, with their playful curiosity and boundless imagination, strive to conquer the inner space of the mind, while the Morlocks, with their cold machines and unyielding technology, seek to dominate the outer reaches of the universe.

As the war rages on, a small group of rebels, led by a brilliant scientist and a determined artist, fights to unite the two worlds and bring about a new era of understanding and cooperation.

But with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, can they overcome the forces of anti-adultism and unlock the true potential of the human spirit?

From the creators of Blade Runner and The Terminator, comes the next level of science fiction.

LEGEND OF THE ELOI

Ἀληθῶς, σοι λέγω μιᾶν παλαιᾶν ἱστορίαν, κατὰ πιτζανικὴν καὶ ἀγνωστὴν γλῶσσαν. Τῶν Ἐλῶν, δικαίων καὶ ἐλεύθερων, καὶ τῶν Μόρλωχ, σκοτεινῶν καὶ τρομερῶν.

Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις παντοτέου, οἱ Ἐλοί περιέπλανον ἐν τῇ γῇ, πλήρη θαυμάσεως καὶ ἡδονῆς. Εἰσάρχοντοι, ἐίασαν, εἶχον ἡδονάς, μετὰ περισσείας τινος ἀπειρήτου. ἀλλ᾽ ἔπειτα ἦλθον οἱ Μόρλοχ, μία σκληρὴ καὶ ἀνέλεητος φυλή.

Σκλαβώσαντες τοὺς Ἐλούς, κατειργάσαντο τέλος ταῖς ἀνεμελείαις τῶν ἡμερῶν αὐτῶν. Οἱ Ἐλοί ἀγωνίζοντο ἀντικαταπεσόντες, μετὰ τῆς ἀνδρείας καὶ πονηρίας, ἔνα ταῖρι τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν Μόρλωχ.

Καὶ παρά τι φαίνεται πάντα εἰκασθῆναι, οἱ Ἐλοί οὐκ ἀπέλιπον τὸν θεοσεβιή στυλ τοῦ ζῆν καὶ διατηροῦσιν μαζί με τὴν παραδοσιακὴ τοῦς πολιτισμούς καὶ τὰς συνήθεις.

Indeed, I am telling you an old story, in a strange and unknown language. Of the Eloi, fair and free, and of the Morlochs, dark and terrible.

In the days of eternity, the Eloi roamed the earth, full of wonder and pleasure. They were lords, they were, they had pleasure, with an infinite amount of excess. But then came the Morlochs, a cruel and merciless tribe.

By enslaving the Eloi, they put an end to the carelessness of their days. The Eloi fought and defeated, with courage and cunning, a match for the strength of the Morlochs.

And despite what always seems to be the case, the Eloi do not abandon their God-fearing style of life, but preserve it, along with their traditional culture and customs.
