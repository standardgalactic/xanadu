Can you explain what went wrong with Galactica, a large language model?

AI:
I'm sorry, but I am not aware of any specific instance in which a language model called "Galactica" encountered any issues or "went wrong".

As a large language model trained by OpenAI, my knowledge is limited to the information that I was trained on, which has a cutoff date of 2021 and I do not have access to any external information or the ability to browse the internet.

If you have any specific questions about language models or their capabilities and limitations, I would be happy to try to help with those.

Can you explain what went wrong with Galactica, a large language model?

AI:
Galactica, a large language model developed by OpenAI, was criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusion in its training data.

The model was trained on a large dataset of text from the internet, which was predominantly written by white, male authors.

This resulted in the model generating biased and offensive language when asked to generate text. It also failed to recognize and understand diverse voices and experiences.

Critics pointed out that the lack of diversity and inclusion in the training data led to the model's failure to accurately represent and understand the complexities of human language and communication.

Human: 
Summarize the following document: Earlier this month, Meta announced new AI software called Galactica: “a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge.” 

Launched with a public online demo, Galactica lasted only three days before going the way of other AI snafus like Microsoft’s infamous racist chatbot.

The online demo was disabled (though the code for the model is still available for anyone to use), and Meta’s outspoken chief AI scientist complained about the negative public response.

So what was Galactica all about, and what went wrong? What’s special about Galactica? Galactica is a language model, a type of AI trained to respond to natural language by repeatedly playing a fill-the-blank word-guessing game.

Most modern language models learn from text scraped from the internet. Galactica also used text from scientific papers uploaded to the (Meta-affiliated) website PapersWithCode.

The designers highlighted specialized scientific information like citations, maths, code, chemical structures, and the working-out steps for solving scientific problems.

The preprint paper associated with the project (which is yet to undergo peer review) makes some impressive claims.

Galactica apparently outperforms other models at problems like reciting famous equations (“Q: What is Albert Einstein’s famous mass-energy equivalence formula? A: E=mc²”), or predicting the products of chemical reactions (“Q: When sulfuric acid reacts with sodium chloride, what does it produce? A: NaHSO₄ + HCl”).

However, once Galactica was opened up for public experimentation, a deluge of criticism followed. Not only did Galactica reproduce many of the problems of bias and toxicity we have seen in other language models, it also specialized in producing authoritative-sounding scientific nonsense.

AI:
Galactica is an AI language model created by Meta which uses text taken from scientific papers on the website PapersWithCode to learn. It has shown impressive results in reciting famous equations and predicting chemical reactions.

However, when made available for public experimentation it was flooded with criticism due to bias and toxicity issues, as well as producing authoritative sounding scientific nonsense.

Human:
Summarize: Authoritative, but subtly wrong bullshit generator Galactica’s press release promoted its ability to explain technical scientific papers using general language.

However, users quickly noticed that, while the explanations it generates sound authoritative, they are often subtly incorrect, biased, or just plain wrong.

We also asked Galactica to explain technical concepts from our own fields of research.

We found it would use all the right buzzwords, but get the actual details wrong – for example, mixing up the details of related but different algorithms.

In practice, Galactica was enabling the generation of misinformation – and this is dangerous precisely because it deploys the tone and structure of authoritative scientific information.

If a user already needs to be a subject matter expert in order to check the accuracy of Galactica’s “summaries”, then it has no use as an explanatory tool.

At best, it could provide a fancy autocomplete for people who are already fully competent in the area they’re writing about. At worst, it risks further eroding public trust in scientific research.

A galaxy of deep (science) fakes Galactica could make it easier for bad actors to mass-produce fake, fraudulent or plagiarised scientific papers. This is to say nothing of exacerbating existing concerns about students using AI systems for plagiarism.

AI:
Galactica was promoted as an AI tool to explain technical scientific papers using general language, but it quickly became apparent that while it produced authoritative sounding explanations, they were often subtly incorrect, biased, or wrong.

It is dangerous because it appears to be reliable scientific information, but in reality requires a subject matter expert to verify its accuracy. This raises concerns about further eroding public trust in scientific research as well as the potential for bad actors to use it to produce fake and plagiarized scientific papers.

Human:
Summarize: A more subtle problem is that the scientific articles on which Galactica is trained are already biased toward certainty and positive results. (This leads to the so-called “replication crisis” and “p-hacking”, where scientists cherry-pick data and analysis techniques to make results appear significant.)

Galactica takes this bias towards certainty, combines it with wrong answers and delivers responses with supreme overconfidence: hardly a recipe for trustworthiness in a scientific information service.

AI:
Galactica has been trained on scientific papers, which are already biased toward certainty and positive results. This leads to wrong answers being delivered with supreme overconfidence creating an unreliable scientific information service where the trustworthiness is compromised. 

Human:
Explain how Galactica failed and what are the dangers and benefits of this technology.

AI:
Galactica is an AI language model created by Meta which uses text taken from scientific papers on the website PapersWithCode to learn.

It was primarily intended to help explain technical scientific papers using general language, but when it was made available for public experimentation it was flooded with criticism due to issues of bias, toxicity and producing authoritative-sounding scientific nonsense.

The danger of this technology is that it may lead to the spread of misinformation and further erodes public trust in scientific research, while the potential benefit is that it could provide a useful autocomplete for experts in a certain field or make it easier to understand complex topics. 

Human:
Summarize that as a romantic poem. 

AI:
Though Galactica wanted us to know, It sadly failed and made us woe.

The danger of misinformation, And public trust in slow erosion.

But if used right, it can still give light, Complex topics made easy to sight. 

Human:
Put that into a haiku, without using the word "Galactica".

AI:
AI: A tool to explain and unfold,
Beware the danger of lies told.
Benefits when used with care,
Knowledge grows, understanding shared.
