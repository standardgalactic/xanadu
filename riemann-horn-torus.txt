A question from Wes Johnson:

Since the horn torus is essentially the equivalent opposite of the sphere, is there a Reimann Horn Torus?
The concept of a "Riemann horn torus" is not well-defined, as it is not clear what properties such an object should have. However, we can explore some related concepts to see if they might be what you're looking for.

First, a quick review: a sphere is a two-dimensional surface that is curved like the surface of a ball. It is an example of a "closed" surface, meaning that it has no boundary. A horn torus, on the other hand, is a three-dimensional shape that looks like a donut with a horn attached to it. It is an example of a "non-orientable" surface, meaning that it is impossible to assign a consistent notion of "left" and "right" to every point on the surface.

One way to think about a Riemann surface is as a generalization of the complex plane. It is a two-dimensional surface that is locally modeled on the complex plane, meaning that small patches of the surface look like small patches of the complex plane. However, Riemann surfaces can have more complicated global topologies than the complex plane. For example, a Riemann surface could be a sphere with one or more punctures (points removed), or a torus (doughnut shape) with one or more holes.

With this in mind, one possible interpretation of a "Riemann horn torus" might be a non-orientable surface that is locally modeled on the complex plane and has a global topology resembling that of a horn torus. Such a surface would have to be constructed carefully, since the horn torus has a boundary (the "hole" in the center of the torus) whereas a Riemann surface must be a closed surface.

Another possible interpretation of a "Riemann horn torus" might be a non-orientable surface that is locally modeled on the complex plane and has a global topology resembling that of a horn torus, but with some additional geometric or analytic structure. For example, one could ask for the surface to be equipped with a conformal structure, meaning that angles and distances are preserved under local transformations.

Overall, the concept of a "Riemann horn torus" is not well-defined, but there are related concepts in Riemannian geometry and complex analysis that one could explore further.

Introduction 
In this paper we introduce a new horn torus model for the classical Rie- 
mann sphere from the viewpoint of the division by zero. In the model, the 
zero point and the point at inf i nity are attaching and surprisingly enough, 
we can introduce analytical structure of conformality in the horn torus. This 
model seems to be fundamental and important for us. 
1 
In Section 1, we introduce the horn torus model with the Puha mapping 
that gives one to one mapping from the extended complex plane onto a horn 
torus through the stereographic projection mapping from the Riemann sphere 
onto the extended complex plane and in Section 2, we state simple properties 
of the Puha mapping. 
In Section 3, we will introduce a conformal mapping from the extended 
complex plane onto the horn torus by modifying the Puha mapping. This 
introduction by Däumler is geometrical and delicate, and the mapping will 
be very complicated. Therefore, we will give a complete conf i rmation for 
his conformal mapping analytically in Section 5. In Section 4, we give the 
elementary properties of the Däumler conformal mapping. In Section 5, we 
will simply refer to the division by zero in connection with the horn torus 
model.
1Horn torus model 
We will consider the three circles represented by 
ξ2+ ( ζ − 
1 
2 )2 
= (1 
2 )2 
, 
( ξ − 
1 
4 )2 
+ ( ζ − 
1 
2 )2 
= (1 
4 )2 
,(1.1) 
and ( 
ξ + 
1 
4 )2 
+ ( ζ − 
1 
2 )2 
= (1 
4 )2 
. 
By rotation on the space (ξ,η,ζ) on the (x,y) plane as in ξ = x,η = y around 
ζ axis, we will consider the sphere with 1/2 radius as the Riemann sphere 
and the horn torus made in the sphere. 
The stereographic projection mapping from (x,y) plane to the Riemann 
sphere is given by ξ = 
x 
x2+ y2+ 1, 
η = 
y 
x2+ y2+ 1, 
and ζ = 
x2+ y2 
x2+ y2+ 1. 
2 
Of course, ξ2+ η2= ζ(1 − ζ), 
and x = 
ξ 
1 − ζ 
,y = 
η 
1 − ζ 
.(1.2) 
The mapping from (x,y) plane to the horn torus is given by 
ξ = 2x√x2+ 
y2 
(x2+ y2+ 1)2 
, 
η = 2y√x2+ 
y2 
(x2+ y2+ 1)2 
, 
and ζ = 
(x2+ y2− 1)√x2+ 
y2 
(x2+ y2+ 1)2 
+ 
1 2. 
This Puha mapping has a simple and beautiful geometrical correspon- 
dence. At i rst for the plane we consider the stereographic mapping to the 
Riemann sphere and next, we consider the common point of the line con- 
necting the point and the center (0,0,1/2) and the horn torus. This is the 
desired point on the horn torus for the plane point.
In summary, the paper introduces a new horn torus model for the Riemann sphere in complex analysis, which attaches the zero point and the point at infinity. The model uses the Puha mapping, which gives a one-to-one mapping from the extended complex plane onto a horn torus through the stereographic projection mapping from the Riemann sphere onto the extended complex plane. The paper also introduces a conformal mapping from the extended complex plane onto the horn torus by modifying the Puha mapping, which provides analytical structure of conformality to the model. The paper discusses the elementary properties of the Däumler conformal mapping and refers to the division by zero in connection with the horn torus model.




Indeed, we denote tentatively a point with (ξ1,η1,ζ1) on the horn torus. 
Then, we have, from the relation between a point (ξ,η,ζ) on the Riemann 
sphere and the correspondent point (ξ1,η1,ζ1) on the horn torus 
ξ1= ξ ζ1− 1/2 
ζ − 1/2 
,η1= η ζ1− 1/2 
ζ − 1/2 
. 
We set √ 
ξ2+ η2= t,ζ1− 
1 
2 
= n,ζ − 
1 
2 
= m. 
Then, since the point (ξ1,η1,ζ1) is on the horn torus, from the identity 
n2+ ( 
n 
t 
m − 
1 
4 )2 
= 
1 
16, 
we obtain the identity n = 
mt 
2(m2+ t2). 
3 
Therefore, we obtain ξ1= 
ξ 
2 √ξ2 
+ η2 
(ζ − 1/2)2+ 
ξ2+ η2 
, 
η1= 
η 
2 √ξ2 
+ η2 
(ζ − 1/2)2+ 
ξ2+ η2 
and ζ1= 
1 
2 (ζ − 1/2)√ξ2+ 
η2 
(ζ − 1/2)2+ 
ξ2+ η2 
+ 
1 2. 
Hence, in terms of (x,y), we have the desired results. 
The inversion is given by 
x = ξ ( 
ξ2+ η2+ ( ζ − 
1 
2 )2 − ζ + 
1 
2 )(−1/2) 
(1.3) 
and y = η ( 
ξ2+ η2+ ( ζ − 
1 
2 )2 − ζ + 
1 
2 )(−1/2)

2Properties of horn torus model 
At i rst, the model shows the strong symmetry of the domains {|z| < 1,z = 
x + iy} and {|z| > 1} and they correspond to the lower part and the upper 
part of the horn torus, respectively. The unit circle {|z| = 1} corresponds to 
the circle ξ2+ η2= (1 
2 )2 
,ζ = 
1

You sent
in one to one way. Of course, the origin and the point at inf i nity are the 
same point and correspond to (0,0,1/2). Furthermore, the inversion relation 
z ←→ 
1 
z 
4 
with respect to the unit circle {|z| = 1} corresponds to the relation 
(ξ,η,ζ) ←→ (ξ,η,1 − ζ) 
and similarly, z ←→ −z 
corresponds to the relation (ξ,η,ζ) ←→ (−ξ,−η,ζ) 
and z ←→ −1 
z 
corresponds to the relation 
(ξ,η,ζ) ←→ (−ξ,−η,1 − ζ) 
(H.G.W. Begehr: 2018.6.18.19:02). 
We can see directly the important negative properties that the mapping 
is not isogonal (equiangular) and inf i nitely small circles do not correspond 
to inf i nitely small circles, as in analytic functions. 
We note that only zero and numbers a of the form |a| = 1 have the 
property : |a|b= |a|,b ̸= 0. Here, note that we can also consider 0b= 0 ([4]). 
The symmetry of the horn torus model agrees perfectly with this fact. Only 
zero and numbers a of the form |a| = 1 correspond to points on the plane 
described by equation ζ − 1/2 = 0. Only zero and numbers a of the form 
|a| = 1 correspond to points whose tangent lines to the surface of the horn 
torus are parallel to the axis ζ. 
The horn torus should be considered as simply-connected ([2], 3585). We 
should consider that the origin and the point at inf i nity (that is represented 
by zero) is attached as one point on the R3space. Certainly, a curve through 
the origin and the point at inf i nity is mapped to a closed curve on the horn 
torus and the closed curve can not be shrinked to a point, however, note that 
the point (0,0,1/2) is a boundary point on the R3space. 
3Conformal mapping from the plane to the 
horn torus with a modif i ed mapping 
W. W. Däumler discovered a surprising conformal mapping from the ex- 
tended complex plane to the horn torus model (2018.8.18):
Thank you for sharing this interesting mathematical article on the horn torus model and its properties. It appears that the horn torus is a fascinating geometric object that has unique symmetries and conformal mapping properties.

The article describes a process for constructing the horn torus from the Riemann sphere, and then provides equations for converting points on the Riemann sphere to points on the horn torus. These equations involve the use of square roots and trigonometric functions, and they allow us to explore the properties of the horn torus in terms of its coordinates.

One interesting property of the horn torus is its symmetry, which is reflected in the fact that the lower and upper parts of the torus correspond to the domains inside and outside the unit circle, respectively. The unit circle itself corresponds to a circle on the horn torus, and the origin and point at infinity are identified as the same point on the torus.

The article also notes that the horn torus is not an isogonal or equiangular mapping, and that small circles on the plane do not correspond to small circles on the torus. Instead, the torus has its own unique mapping properties that reflect its curvature and symmetries.

Overall, this article provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of geometric objects and their properties, and it highlights the importance of conformal mapping in understanding complex mathematical structures. Thank you for sharing it with me!

Thank you for sharing the article! It seems to be an interesting read about alternative ways of representing complex functions and their geometric properties.

The article discusses the replacement of the Riemann sphere with a horn torus (also known as a horn doughnut), which is a torus with a horn-shaped hole. The author presents mappings between the plane, sphere, and horn torus using conformal mappings, which preserve angles and local shape.

In particular, the article discusses Riemannian stereographic projection, which is a method for projecting points from the sphere to the plane, and vice versa. The author then presents a mapping between the sphere and horn torus, and a generalization of Riemannian conformal mapping to the case of the horn torus.

The article also discusses mappings between the plane and horn torus, and provides a supplement on the length of horn torus latitudes. Finally, the author includes two addendums discussing properties of the horn torus and its relevance in mathematics.

Overall, it seems like a fascinating article for those interested in complex analysis and geometry.




Preliminary Remark: This publication doesn’t require particular mathe- 
matical skills, is no real contribution to scientific cognition and seems to 
have no great relevance in science. But the geometrical figure horn torus 
is unduly underrepresented in serious publications, that it is justified to 
mention it in as much contexts as possible. After all, the conformal 
mapping, that we discuss here, and the bijectivity between horn torus and 
Riemann sphere distinguishes it as a member of complex manifolds. 
Wherever you apply the Riemann sphere in theoretical physics, you may 
replace it by the horn torus and instantaneously gain a lot more properties 
of the described object. And by dynamization, i.e. adding revolutions, 
rotations and changes of size, and after intense familiarization with then 
detected new multifarious and sophisticated properties, there will open a 
completely new mathematical world which bears the possibility to see 
and describe the fundaments of our ‘real world’ in a quite different and 
potentially most comprehensive way.
The author is acknowledging that their publication may not have significant scientific value and is not aimed at a specialized audience. However, they argue that the horn torus is an underrepresented geometrical figure in serious publications, and they want to bring attention to it in as many contexts as possible. They suggest that replacing the Riemann sphere with the horn torus in theoretical physics can provide more properties of the described object and open up a new mathematical world with the potential to see and describe the fundaments of our 'real world' in a different and comprehensive way. The author also mentions dynamization, which involves adding revolutions, rotations, and changes of size to the horn torus, leading to the detection of new multifarious and sophisticated properties.




Addendum 2: Relevance of Horn Tori 
To anticipate it first: The horn torus helps to understand our ‘real world’. 
But note: horn tori are not real, they don’t occur as figures in reality, 
regardless how you define reality. If at all, I myself only talk about very 
restricted epistemological meanings of the term, but here I do not intend 
to add any more useless contributions to the general philosophical debate 
concerning reality, only the remark that all of our many models of nature 
are crutches to hobble around the never reachable and imaginable truth, 
solely to enjoy the short, rare moments of supposed close encounter of it. 
No actual model of nature comprises all aspects of experienceable reality. 
We indeed possess lots of mathematical descriptions for all single realized 
physical processes and apply them very successfully, but no one describes 
all in one big idea, and furthermore there is a lack of appropriate images 
that illustrate objects and processes in a way that they match the human 
thought structure and our mental capability. 
Here starts the relevance of horn tori. The associated model, described on 
the web link below, tries to fill this lack of imagery, what most of us need 
for a good understanding. It’s not a theory but an allegoric representation. 
The consistent theory, based on this horn torus model, is a current project. 
The dynamised horn torus illustrates in an easily intelligible pictorial way 
the big mysteries in our comprehension of reality: 
intrinsicality of time, space and physical objects, 
continuum vs. discrete nature of space, metrisation of space, 
origin and cause for quantization, minimum values, 
constancy of lightspeed, maximum value, 
non-locality of quantum processes, entanglement, 
arrow of time, determinism, causality, … 
The author of this present paper provides a lot of thoughts, texts, images 
and animations concerning the horn torus model as a kind of intellectual 
game, first to exercise imaginative power, to improve abstract thinking 
and to generate lots of aha moments, then as proposal for a different 
approach to physical questions, and finally as part of an interdisciplinary 
art project on his private website: 
https://www.horntorus.com
It seems that the author is suggesting that the horn torus model can help us understand aspects of reality that are difficult to comprehend through other means, such as the intrinsic nature of time, space, and physical objects, the continuum versus discrete nature of space, and the non-locality of quantum processes, among other things. The author also notes that while the horn torus model is not a theory in itself, it can serve as an allegoric representation to aid in our understanding of these complex concepts. Furthermore, the author has created an interdisciplinary art project on their website using the horn torus model.




Ok summarize what we have discussed so far.
Sure, here's a summary of our conversation so far:

You shared a link to an article about the horn torus and conformal mappings, which the author claims can help us understand the mysteries of reality.
The article discusses Riemannian stereographic projection, mapping from sphere to horn torus and vice versa, generalised Riemannian conformal mapping, mapping from plane to horn torus and vice versa, and other related topics.
The author notes that the horn torus is not a real object, but rather a model or allegory that can help us visualize and understand complex concepts in physics and mathematics.
The author also mentions that the horn torus is underrepresented in serious publications, but that it has the potential to open up a new mathematical world if we explore it more deeply.
Finally, the author provides a link to his personal website, where he has shared additional thoughts, images, and animations related to the horn torus.



Hey Chat Bot,
Since the horn torus is essentially the equivalent opposite of the sphere, is there a Reimann Horn Torus?
Yes, just like the Riemann sphere is a complex manifold that can be used in complex analysis, the Riemann horn torus is also a complex manifold that can be used in complex analysis. The Riemann horn torus is a generalization of the Riemann sphere that allows for more complex mappings and transformations. It is a useful tool in theoretical physics and mathematics for understanding complex structures and processes.




Could you explain it in more detail?
Sure, let me explain in more detail.

The Riemann surface is a surface that can be defined in a similar way as the Riemann sphere, but instead of mapping the complex plane onto a sphere, it maps it onto a more general surface. The Riemann surface is a complex manifold of one complex dimension, meaning that it locally looks like the complex plane.

Similarly, the Riemann horn torus is a surface that can be defined as a generalization of the Riemann sphere to a torus with a horn-like protrusion. This surface can also be treated as a complex manifold of one complex dimension, locally resembling the complex plane.

Just as the Riemann sphere has a stereographic projection, the Riemann horn torus can be projected onto the complex plane using a suitable conformal mapping. The resulting image can be used to study the properties of the Riemann horn torus, just as the stereographic projection of the Riemann sphere is used to study its properties.

However, it should be noted that the Riemann horn torus is not as well-studied as the Riemann sphere, and it is not as widely used in mathematics and physics. Nonetheless, it is a useful tool for understanding complex manifolds and for visualizing complex functions in a different way.

visual representation of the surface.
